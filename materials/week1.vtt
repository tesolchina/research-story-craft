HKBU Classroom: Zhang Yuvai.

33
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.960
HKBU Classroom: Aye.

34
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.380
HKBU Classroom: Dong Jun.

35
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.620
HKBU Classroom: David.

36
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.190
HKBU Classroom: Qingwei, okay, good.

37
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.000
HKBU Classroom: Thanks, Wales.

38
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.129
HKBU Classroom: Ethan? Ethan here yet?

39
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.689
HKBU Classroom: Okay, Con Lee, is Con Lee here?

40
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.149
HKBU Classroom: Not yet.

41
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.400
HKBU Classroom: Alright.

42
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.370
HKBU Classroom: So, can you all access this page?

43
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.460
HKBU Classroom: Yes?

44
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.780
HKBU Classroom: this page.

45
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.520
HKBU Classroom: No problem, right?

46
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.400
HKBU Classroom: Alright, so thank you so much for joining this section.

47
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.579
HKBU Classroom: I want to begin with, kind of talk about… The course in general.

48
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.579
HKBU Classroom: I used to be the coordinator of this course, but then I… I left the team

49
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.129
HKBU Classroom: Like, 5 years ago, so this is…

50
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.099
HKBU Classroom: the first time I rejoined this course, and hopefully I will become the course coordinator again.

51
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.750
HKBU Classroom: If you look at this page.

52
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.880
HKBU Classroom: You can see that, we are actually offering… the ERPP program.

53
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.140
HKBU Classroom: And, hopefully you can…

54
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.949
HKBU Classroom: you know, consider joining this program later, which is more like a one-on-one services that I can help you.

55
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.229
HKBU Classroom: To improve your manuscript for publication.

56
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:26.370
HKBU Classroom: But, the challenge is that… with AI these days.

57
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.939
HKBU Classroom: It becomes less obvious or clear

58
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.850
HKBU Classroom: How a language teacher can actually help.

59
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.540
HKBU Classroom: Right?

60
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.430
HKBU Classroom: So, one of the articles I want to share with you, which you can look at a little bit.

61
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.090
HKBU Classroom: is… This one…

62
00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:02.919
HKBU Classroom: So, later on, when you have time, you can check this out. This is an article I published when I was a PhD student at CTU.

63
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:11.850
HKBU Classroom: Okay? So, I was a language teacher at Hwajong University of Science and Technology for nearly 10 years. Anyone from Wuhan?

64
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.020
HKBU Classroom: Anyone from Hubei, raise your hand.

65
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.380
HKBU Classroom: Oh, okay, so I'm from Wuhan.

66
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.900
HKBU Classroom: So I spent almost 10 years there, and one thing I did there is to help people publish.

67
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.810
HKBU Classroom: papers, alright? I spent time talking with them and trying to figure out how to write a better paper, how to improve their writing.

68
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.229
HKBU Classroom: And then later on, I actually published an article talking about the process.

69
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:47.039
HKBU Classroom: And also, this is the reason why I'm the coordinator of ERPP, so here at BU, I also try to, offer students this kind of help.

70
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.150
HKBU Classroom: But, as I said earlier, With large language model, do we really need language teachers anymore?

71
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.769
HKBU Classroom: I mean, this question is a very important one.

72
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.150
HKBU Classroom: And, unfortunately, I don't think we have a very good answer for language teachers.

73
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.680
HKBU Classroom: Because when students have access to large language models, they can solve many problems.

74
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.855
HKBU Classroom: Right?

75
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.609
HKBU Classroom: Because, in a way, I would… I would argue that the language teachers are just a small language model.

76
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.209
HKBU Classroom: Right? The principles behind The language teacher and AI is quite similar.

77
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:36.530
HKBU Classroom: If you think about it, I got my education, years of training, become familiar with the language, so…

78
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:44.340
HKBU Classroom: When I speak to you, I can tell you what is the best version of the next sentence.

79
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.950
HKBU Classroom: For that manuscript.

80
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.670
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

81
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:54.780
HKBU Classroom: Because I recognized the patterns in all the data, all the training data that I was exposed to.

82
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.150
HKBU Classroom: AI is doing the same.

83
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.659
HKBU Classroom: But AI got more data.

84
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.229
HKBU Classroom: You know, enormous amount of data compared to the data I was exposed to.

85
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.040
HKBU Classroom: Right?

86
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.599
HKBU Classroom: But of course, I think I also have some advantage.

87
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:24.469
HKBU Classroom: Number one is I'm more efficient, right? My brain is more efficient than a large language model. I consume less electricity.

88
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.989
HKBU Classroom: And also, I have more contextual knowledge and contextual information to make decisions.

89
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.379
HKBU Classroom: So… Again, I think the challenge, the question is still there.

90
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:47.160
HKBU Classroom: Can language teachers still play a role in the process of helping research students?

91
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.490
HKBU Classroom: With their publication efforts.

92
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.250
HKBU Classroom: And I think the answer is to build a partnership.

93
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.970
HKBU Classroom: Alright.

94
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.040
HKBU Classroom: I mean, all the students here, you already have a partnership with AI,

95
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.959
HKBU Classroom: And I assume that you are doing well.

96
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.110
HKBU Classroom: The question and the challenge for me is…

97
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.390
HKBU Classroom: Can I still play a role?

98
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.430
HKBU Classroom: Can I still join the process?

99
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:23.649
HKBU Classroom: Of you trying to figure out how to do the research and write a good paper.

100
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.049
HKBU Classroom: But then, AI is helping you, but then I can also help you.

101
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.320
HKBU Classroom: So that's why,

102
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.109
HKBU Classroom: We are here.

103
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:48.709
HKBU Classroom: And I think it's very lucky for me that I have a room full of computer science majors.

104
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.129
HKBU Classroom: or computer science PhD students. I mean, we have, one math student here, but,

105
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.140
HKBU Classroom: You also have programming skills.

106
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.910
HKBU Classroom: Because… The way that I'm going to teach this course Would be very different.

107
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.160
HKBU Classroom: From a typical language teacher.

108
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.500
HKBU Classroom: I will be using a lot of programming.

109
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.090
HKBU Classroom: an AI agent.

110
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:19.460
HKBU Classroom: If this is a room of… social science PhD,

111
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.230
HKBU Classroom: or arts PhD students, then I actually will find it more difficult to teach.

112
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.009
HKBU Classroom: Because if I showed them like, the IDE and all the things.

113
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.729
HKBU Classroom: It will be a very steep learning curve.

114
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.309
HKBU Classroom: But for students here, It's very straightforward.

115
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.079
HKBU Classroom: So that's actually a good thing.

116
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.290
HKBU Classroom: I think, it will be…

117
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:56.270
HKBU Classroom: You know, I think we're going to have a lot of, exciting… Time together.

118
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:07.960
HKBU Classroom: Okay, so… this is an article that's… Worth revisiting.

119
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.440
HKBU Classroom: This is an article I published back in 2019.

120
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.540
HKBU Classroom: You know, I got pretty old now.

121
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.749
HKBU Classroom: start talking about the articles I published many years ago.

122
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.780
HKBU Classroom: This is not really an article, it's more like a blog entry.

123
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.990
HKBU Classroom: But it's on nature, right? So it's pretty… pretigious, prestigious.

124
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.130
HKBU Classroom: And, it's talk about how to write effectively for international journals.

125
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.169
HKBU Classroom: You can check it out later, if you like.

126
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.229
HKBU Classroom: But the key messages can be found in this sentence right here.

127
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:05.299
HKBU Classroom: Use modern tools to manage research literature.

128
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.800
HKBU Classroom: Analyze published articles.

129
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.309
HKBU Classroom: And then find language teachers to improve ministry for publication. So this is the key messages.

130
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.410
HKBU Classroom: from the article.

131
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.790
HKBU Classroom: No.

132
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.570
HKBU Classroom: Obviously, this article was published many years ago.

133
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.549
HKBU Classroom: With AI, we need to revisit and reconsider

134
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.400
HKBU Classroom: How we want to modernize our approaches.

135
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.870
HKBU Classroom: The first item is talking about doTero, Mendeley.

136
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.190
HKBU Classroom: And, what's the other one?

137
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.749
HKBU Classroom: What's the one that people use? EndNote. Is that EndNote?

138
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.899
HKBU Classroom: So how many of you use doTERRO? Raise your hand.

139
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.519
HKBU Classroom: How about Mendeli?

140
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.979
HKBU Classroom: How about endnote?

141
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:02.590
HKBU Classroom: Well, Lottero is a great choice, because it's open source, right? So we can actually

142
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.350
HKBU Classroom: Build new things upon that.

143
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:14.150
HKBU Classroom: But, as you can see, With AI, there's a lot of possibilities in terms of how you can

144
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:20.300
HKBU Classroom: optimize the use of the tools, like the tarot. How you manage research literature?

145
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.990
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

146
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.409
HKBU Classroom: So that's something we can, we can look at.

147
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:33.959
HKBU Classroom: Now, analyze published articles. This is probably the most important thing we're going to teach in this course, is

148
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.110
HKBU Classroom: You don't really learn how to write from me.

149
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.499
HKBU Classroom: You learn how to write from published authors, right?

150
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.140
HKBU Classroom: Because… You know, you want to write an article just like them.

151
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:54.459
HKBU Classroom: So we're going to learn how to analyze the published articles, and try to gain insights from them.

152
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.659
HKBU Classroom: And then apply the insights into our writing.

153
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.949
HKBU Classroom: But then again, the question is, can AI help?

154
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.919
HKBU Classroom: Okay, can AI help us?

155
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.789
HKBU Classroom: Analyze published articles.

156
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.429
HKBU Classroom: Because… I can show you how to analyze one paper.

157
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:20.200
HKBU Classroom: But then, if we teach AI to do that, then AI can analyze 1,000 papers for us.

158
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.490
HKBU Classroom: Right?

159
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.909
HKBU Classroom: So, again, that's something we can figure out together.

160
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.300
HKBU Classroom: How to analyze published articles systematically so we will gain insights.

161
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:41.079
HKBU Classroom: Now, the last one, Find language teachers to improve manuscripts for publication.

162
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.129
HKBU Classroom: It's, it's actually quite time-consuming.

163
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.350
HKBU Classroom: To set up meetings like this.

164
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.749
HKBU Classroom: So… how about we find AI teachers?

165
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.279
HKBU Classroom: To improve manuscripts for publication.

166
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:13.800
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean? So these three key ideas from a 2019 article needs to be upgrades

167
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:19.490
HKBU Classroom: into AI-facilitated strategies.

168
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.650
HKBU Classroom: Okay? So that's… that's something we want to keep in mind.

169
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.359
HKBU Classroom: Okay, so that's all I have to say at the beginning.

170
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.370
HKBU Classroom: In terms of the course itself.

171
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.000
HKBU Classroom: You can look at the silos and everything.

172
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.960
HKBU Classroom: I'm sure that you care about assessments, so I just want to quickly tell you about the assessment.

173
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.849
HKBU Classroom: As you can see, this course has been revised after I left the team.

174
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:04.479
HKBU Classroom: And, now we have 60% is on speaking.

175
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.560
HKBU Classroom: Alright.

176
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.430
HKBU Classroom: That seems to suggest something, which is…

177
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.350
HKBU Classroom: Number one, of course, speaking is very important.

178
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:18.229
HKBU Classroom: But then… I suspect that the teaching team

179
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.700
HKBU Classroom: Has some difficulty to figure out, how can we really help you with writing?

180
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:29.479
HKBU Classroom: You know, with AI, with large language model becoming so useful?

181
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:36.140
HKBU Classroom: So that's why the course itself shifts towards Speaking.

182
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.800
HKBU Classroom: Which I believe can be a good thing, because you probably need more help with speaking.

183
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.580
HKBU Classroom: But I think it's also because the AI tools for supporting speaking is not that well developed just yet.

184
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.220
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

185
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.419
HKBU Classroom: But anyway, so… This is how this course will be assessed.

186
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.720
HKBU Classroom: And the good news is that it's a pass-or-fail course.

187
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.290
HKBU Classroom: So you got 65%, you pass.

188
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.489
HKBU Classroom: Alright? So everybody will pass.

189
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.089
HKBU Classroom: Right? We can take that off the table.

190
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.489
HKBU Classroom: As long as you come to class, as long as you,

191
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.979
HKBU Classroom: Do the basic work, you pass.

192
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:24.900
HKBU Classroom: And, I don't want to… Waste your time.

193
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.909
HKBU Classroom: Because, actually, I'm not quite sure whether my approach will work for you.

194
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.169
HKBU Classroom: Everybody has his or her own way of doing things.

195
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.259
HKBU Classroom: So that's why, starting from next week, we will do a small group meeting.

196
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:42.600
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

197
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:49.100
HKBU Classroom: small group meeting so that I will meet 3 of you at a time for 1 hour.

198
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.669
HKBU Classroom: And, we already figured out, kind of, a schedule.

199
00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:03.440
HKBU Classroom: That, yeah, so we can… Kind of have a more… Close discussion and everything.

200
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.920
HKBU Classroom: But then…

201
00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:16.050
HKBU Classroom: Week 5 and 6, there will be presentations, so you guys need to come back. Again, not necessarily everybody will come back, just, have a schedule to have presentation.

202
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.269
HKBU Classroom: And then 7 to 9, week 7 to 9, we're going to have a small group meeting thing again.

203
00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:30.250
HKBU Classroom: And then more presentation… And then consultation, and then presentation. So that's how we're going to do this course.

204
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.900
HKBU Classroom: So, at the very minimum, I hope…

205
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.499
HKBU Classroom: You won't waste your time here.

206
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.190
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

207
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:46.880
HKBU Classroom: But then, of course, we should try to… Figure out something.

208
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.159
HKBU Classroom: that we can use AI more effectively.

209
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.950
HKBU Classroom: To help you with your writing, And not just writing.

210
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.350
HKBU Classroom: Perhaps research as well.

211
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.909
HKBU Classroom: Okay, so that's, that's kind of a basic introduction of this course.

212
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.820
HKBU Classroom: Any question?

213
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.010
HKBU Classroom: Is Kong Lee here yet?

214
00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.540
HKBU Classroom: Okay. Anyone know knows Kang Li?

215
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.710
HKBU Classroom: Great.

216
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:33.780
HKBU Classroom: So, now, I want to talk about… AI agent.

217
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.750
HKBU Classroom: Before I talk about AI Agent, maybe I can just ask around.

218
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.030
HKBU Classroom: And I want to know how you use AI.

219
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.840
HKBU Classroom: I think that's… that can be an important… Question.

220
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.840
HKBU Classroom: So, you and Jin?

221
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.370
HKBU Classroom: So, how do you use AI to help Writing your paper.

222
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.439
HKBU Classroom: Maybe I can talk with Germany, GVC?

223
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:32.040
HKBU Classroom: with my ideas, and if I want to find the latest research papers, I can use, Kansas…

224
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.909
HKBU Classroom: To… Automatically… So you talk to your chatbot?

225
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.909
HKBU Classroom: Yeah, of course. Okay.

226
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:48.660
HKBU Classroom: And, use, pasta, consent, consensus, I, I don't know if you… Use what, sorry? Constant sauce.

227
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:58.370
HKBU Classroom: to, it's a website, which can help you to find, papers that are related

228
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.930
HKBU Classroom: Consensus. Yeah. Oh, okay, consensus. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good. And,

229
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:13.729
HKBU Classroom: And, of course, you need AI to… Fulfill your ideas,

230
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.269
HKBU Classroom: you need to write some code, so I can use a cursor or Copilot.

231
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:29.750
HKBU Classroom: You do use cursor? Yeah, yeah, cursor. Do you use AI agent? The agent mode? Agent mode, of course, agent mode. Okay. But do you use that for writing paper?

232
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:35.210
HKBU Classroom: I'm trying to use that, but, have not.

233
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.220
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

234
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:42.160
HKBU Classroom: Well… you're all computer science majors, right? Except,

235
00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.249
HKBU Classroom: that student from maths department. So I think, it should be straightforward to you.

236
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.490
HKBU Classroom: When we talk to AI, there are two ways, right?

237
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.230
HKBU Classroom: One is through what we call GUI.

238
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.680
HKBU Classroom: Graphical user interface, right? ChatGBT.

239
00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.870
HKBU Classroom: Poe.

240
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.439
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean?

241
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:08.570
HKBU Classroom: But in another way, is… you can actually interact with large language models through API.

242
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.660
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean?

243
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:16.309
HKBU Classroom: So… But of course, agent… the technology of agent may be a little bit different.

244
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.860
HKBU Classroom: So, what I'm suggesting is…

245
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:31.389
HKBU Classroom: We want to revisit this model, a very simple model, right? You're all familiar with this. It's called input process output.

246
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.310
HKBU Classroom: So what we do… do we do here?

247
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:42.900
HKBU Classroom: If you go to ChatGPT or any interface, of course, you can write prompts. The prompt is also input, right?

248
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.539
HKBU Classroom: And perhaps you can also upload the files.

249
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.739
HKBU Classroom: You ride the… The prompts, you give the files, and then the chatbot will

250
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.590
HKBU Classroom: You know, the larger language model will process

251
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:57.700
HKBU Classroom: We'll look at your problems and try to figure things out, and then they will give you output.

252
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.390
HKBU Classroom: But the output would be just text. You see what I mean? So that's kind of…

253
00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.730
HKBU Classroom: the more conventional way of using AI.

254
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.430
HKBU Classroom: 3 years old, right?

255
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:17.019
HKBU Classroom: what I'm suggesting is that What if, when you use cursor, right? When you use cursor.

256
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:25.160
HKBU Classroom: You put together a folder, And in the folder, there's everything you want the AI to look at.

257
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.750
HKBU Classroom: not just… Prompt. Of course, prompt is there.

258
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.740
HKBU Classroom: But it could be your articles, right? It could be your 20 articles or 30 articles.

259
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.249
HKBU Classroom: And then you say, look, I have 30 articles.

260
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.290
HKBU Classroom: Why don't you just go ahead and read through all the 30 articles?

261
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.080
HKBU Classroom: And then I have an idea.

262
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.759
HKBU Classroom: I have an outline.

263
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.469
HKBU Classroom: To write a new paper.

264
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.100
HKBU Classroom: Okay, so in that outline, I've got a couple points.

265
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.790
HKBU Classroom: So you go to those 20 articles and pick up

266
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.549
HKBU Classroom: The points that align with my outline.

267
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.179
HKBU Classroom: And then you can go ahead and generate something for me.

268
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.930
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean?

269
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.890
HKBU Classroom: And that may not be possible when you… use a chatbot.

270
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:18.820
HKBU Classroom: Because if you upload 20 articles to a chatbot, The context window will be… You know?

271
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.839
HKBU Classroom: will be exploded. It won't work.

272
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.670
HKBU Classroom: But, if you are using this approach, It may work.

273
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.849
HKBU Classroom: You hear me?

274
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.020
HKBU Classroom: So… Let's do it! Let's try to do it.

275
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:52.030
HKBU Classroom: Everybody, please fork this… repository.

276
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.230
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

277
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.880
HKBU Classroom: So you can fork this repository, And,

278
00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.790
HKBU Classroom: Clone it to your local environment.

279
00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.409
HKBU Classroom: And, then we'll see how it works.

280
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.929
HKBU Classroom: Is Ethan here?

281
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.710
HKBU Classroom: Oh, okay.

282
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:33.899
HKBU Classroom: Yeah, I want to introduce two of, my, my students and helpers. One is Andy.

283
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:41.569
HKBU Classroom: You say hi, and Ethan. So, they are both, computer science undergraduate students from our university.

284
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.800
HKBU Classroom: And also Kai Tai.

285
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.710
HKBU Classroom: Kaida, do you want to say hi?

286
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.600
HKBU Classroom: He's online.

287
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.659
HKBU Classroom: So, Kaitai is my full-time programming assistant. He recently graduated from

288
00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:03.430
HKBU Classroom: our department at BU as well, as undergraduates. So we actually have a programming team, to build things.

289
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.779
HKBU Classroom: And that's actually one thing that we plan to do.

290
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:14.259
HKBU Classroom: It is to kind of build some tools that can help research students with…

291
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.570
HKBU Classroom: With, with research and writing.

292
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.980
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

293
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.050
HKBU Classroom: So… Have you fork it?

294
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.130
HKBU Classroom: Only 3 students did.

295
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.999
HKBU Classroom: we have… I think we have…

296
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:42.349
HKBU Classroom: everybody would be, like, 20-something. I know two students are not here, So… We can catch up later.

297
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.190
HKBU Classroom: So everybody please fork.

298
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.480
HKBU Classroom: And then you should be able to…

299
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.350
HKBU Classroom: I mean, you can also do it, online.

300
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.420
HKBU Classroom: But that would be VS Code, right? Let me see if I can… Set things up.

301
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.410
HKBU Classroom: So, 11 now, which is great.

302
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:50.619
HKBU Classroom: So, in order to set up, you can actually come to this page, which is under Week 1, there's AI Agents set up.

303
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.349
HKBU Classroom: Well, sorry, I didn't change here. You can use cursor and…

304
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:00.349
HKBU Classroom: And this is, this is the, the, the link.

305
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:17.850
HKBU Classroom: you know, if… if you're not computer science students, then actually, I… I would… I would be in big trouble, because I need to kind of teach students how to install things and everything.

306
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:26.660
HKBU Classroom: Which is why I think to teach a course with computer science students first is a blessing.

307
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.890
HKBU Classroom: you know, I feel very lucky.

308
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:33.529
HKBU Classroom: But again, I also need to figure out How to, kind of.

309
00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.140
HKBU Classroom: Introduce this approach to other students, to students from other disciplines as well.

310
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.850
HKBU Classroom: And that's something I hope everybody can think about a little bit, because

311
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:53.020
HKBU Classroom: Because I think, I think, you know, any, any kind of technology approaches, you can't just assume people know things, right?

312
00:27:55.150 --> 00:28:01.139
HKBU Classroom: You can't really introduce IDE or Cursor or VS Code to everybody, you see what I mean?

313
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.630
HKBU Classroom: If… if you can do that.

314
00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.199
HKBU Classroom: I think life will be much simpler, right?

315
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:12.420
HKBU Classroom: Imagine if everybody is well-educated, being able to code and everything.

316
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:18.700
HKBU Classroom: then we don't have to build a lot of UIs, a lot of… Products.

317
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.939
HKBU Classroom: But… But that's not the case.

318
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:30.569
HKBU Classroom: So that's why Ethan and Andy and Kaitai, you need to help me think about how to do things

319
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:38.260
HKBU Classroom: you know, make it more accessible. But for now, for this semester, we don't have to worry about it. We can directly use the technology.

320
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.680
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

321
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.360
HKBU Classroom: So, what do we do

322
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.599
HKBU Classroom: First of all, you can look at this repository.

323
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.380
HKBU Classroom: Here.

324
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.789
HKBU Classroom: So there's the materials.

325
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.669
HKBU Classroom: Well, this one… There's just silo here, okay? The silo is here.

326
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:19.020
HKBU Classroom: And then there's, like, the 3-presentation folder, and then the writing. Let's focus on the writing, because the other… I haven't really,

327
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.830
HKBU Classroom: Updated that much.

328
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.510
HKBU Classroom: No.

329
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:30.580
HKBU Classroom: for them… The writing folder, we've got a couple of activities, starting from 1.1.

330
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.609
HKBU Classroom: Are we on the same page?

331
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.389
HKBU Classroom: Maybe I want to make sure that we're all on the same page.

332
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.770
HKBU Classroom: 14, so there's still students who haven't forked the repository.

333
00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.689
HKBU Classroom: Raise your hand if you need help forking this repository.

334
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.880
HKBU Classroom: Email, fork.

335
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.749
HKBU Classroom: Okay, let me, let me just very quickly go through this.

336
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.799
HKBU Classroom: Now, Activity 1.1, what am I doing here?

337
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.529
HKBU Classroom: So this is the mapping instructions.

338
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.920
HKBU Classroom: Now, I'm using this very classical model, which is input process output.

339
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.009
HKBU Classroom: So what is the input?

340
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:43.510
HKBU Classroom: The input is… The silo of the course.

341
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.150
HKBU Classroom: Right?

342
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:50.160
HKBU Classroom: The silo of the course, and then the writing assignment brief.

343
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.700
HKBU Classroom: So this is the assessment instruction.

344
00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:01.740
HKBU Classroom: For the writing component, And then there's the student's goal.

345
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.589
HKBU Classroom: And then there's a tutor information.

346
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:14.590
HKBU Classroom: Okay. Well, actually, I think the silo is… I didn't put a silo here, maybe I need to.

347
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.589
HKBU Classroom: Put it here.

348
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:24.109
HKBU Classroom: So you copy-pass. You know how to copy-pass, right? You don't need me to teach you.

349
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.940
HKBU Classroom: You copy-pass.

350
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:34.360
HKBU Classroom: And, so this is… this is our instruction file.

351
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.260
HKBU Classroom: There's the input.

352
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.750
HKBU Classroom: The input, including, the silo.

353
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.690
HKBU Classroom: Including the assignment, the assignment you need to work on.

354
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:50.570
HKBU Classroom: And then there's also the goal… students' goals and reflection. Now, this is the part you have to write.

355
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.489
HKBU Classroom: Because right now, I actually write something which is a sample.

356
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.890
HKBU Classroom: So you have to tell AI who…

357
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:08.239
HKBU Classroom: You are, and what kind of difficulty or challenge you may have with writing, or, you know, what could be your strengths, and everything.

358
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:16.260
HKBU Classroom: So… so this is made up by AI, but you need to create something. You have to write your own file.

359
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:17.630
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean?

360
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.080
HKBU Classroom: So, what's your strength?

361
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.729
HKBU Classroom: As an academic writer.

362
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.669
HKBU Classroom: What's your weaknesses?

363
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.800
HKBU Classroom: And, in what area do you need help?

364
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:32.139
HKBU Classroom: So this is something you have to tell AI.

365
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.839
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean? So, at some point, you have to create a new file, a copy of this file, and start writing.

366
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.169
HKBU Classroom: Okay, write down what you need.

367
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.399
HKBU Classroom: And then this is info about me.

368
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.549
HKBU Classroom: Tudor's names, I mean, Wong, blah blah blah, that's about me.

369
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.490
HKBU Classroom: Okay, now, all this would be the input.

370
00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.070
HKBU Classroom: to AI, through FirePass.

371
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.420
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

372
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:09.470
HKBU Classroom: Now, what's the… what's the process? This is… this is my prompt. This is the prompt for the AI agent.

373
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.590
HKBU Classroom: Given the information above, develop a plan on completing the assignment.

374
00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:22.170
HKBU Classroom: To spend up to 3 hours with AI assistants and how to work with the tutor to develop my own writing skills and AI skills.

375
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.730
HKBU Classroom: And then output, create two Markdown files in a folder.

376
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:38.189
HKBU Classroom: One is a detailed plan for completing the writing assignment using AI Assistant within 3 hours.

377
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.689
HKBU Classroom: And two is, a plan for working with me to develop writing skills and AI competencies.

378
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:49.219
HKBU Classroom: Now… How do you tell this to AI?

379
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.000
HKBU Classroom: Anyone know?

380
00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.819
HKBU Classroom: Your computer science majors, you should know.

381
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.270
HKBU Classroom: Do you understand what we're talking about here?

382
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.029
HKBU Classroom: I mean, if this is a group… a room of students from social science, then…

383
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:16.989
HKBU Classroom: I have to take a much more gentler approach, but since you're a computer science major, I assume that you understand what I'm talking about here.

384
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.659
HKBU Classroom: Any… anyone?

385
00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:42.670
HKBU Classroom: Right, so, well, a good way to test whether you know what I'm talking about is, what should be the next step?

386
00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:54.120
HKBU Classroom: How do I send this to AI Agent? That's my question.

387
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:05.490
HKBU Classroom: The code across the… You can use, out.

388
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:11.670
HKBU Classroom: 2… Add? That's good. Well, usually what I do is I just copy-pass.

389
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.719
HKBU Classroom: I copy this, and then I send it over.

390
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.829
HKBU Classroom: And hit enter.

391
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.760
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean? But of course, this… I have already done it, you see what I mean? So…

392
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:27.910
HKBU Classroom: So, I need to… cause… cause the… the result is already here.

393
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.259
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean?

394
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.560
HKBU Classroom: So, what I need to do is, I need to delete this.

395
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.520
HKBU Classroom: If I want to run this again.

396
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.219
HKBU Classroom: Let me see, I have to delete this.

397
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.919
HKBU Classroom: And then, I send it over.

398
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.620
HKBU Classroom: Make sure it's agent mode, right? Make sure it's agent mode.

399
00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:58.230
HKBU Classroom: You can do auto, auto, And what will happen is…

400
00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.649
HKBU Classroom: The AI agent will read this file.

401
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:16.690
HKBU Classroom: And in this file, there are file paths to all the other files. So the AI agent will go ahead and read all the files in the input section, and then read my process instruction, and then execute the instruction, and then generate the output into the output folder.

402
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:31.689
HKBU Classroom: I want to claim some credit to this approach, because… I figured this out myself.

403
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:38.140
HKBU Classroom: But I'm not sure whether this is really the best approach.

404
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.589
HKBU Classroom: Obviously not the best for the general public.

405
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:44.110
HKBU Classroom: You see me?

406
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.279
HKBU Classroom: But, I think it could be the best for you guys.

407
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:48.460
HKBU Classroom: For us.

408
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.910
HKBU Classroom: who know… Programming, a little bit.

409
00:36:55.090 --> 00:37:02.460
HKBU Classroom: Now, you can see… they regenerated… wait, still working.

410
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:05.220
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

411
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.780
HKBU Classroom: So I hope this makes sense to you.

412
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:15.519
HKBU Classroom: If not, then we spend a little bit more time to make sure that we are all on the same page.

413
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:27.299
HKBU Classroom: Because if you understand this approach, Then… You can go home.

414
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:33.399
HKBU Classroom: and start Using this approach to optimize your research.

415
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:42.309
HKBU Classroom: Because… We can change the input to anything else. We can change the process prompts to

416
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.500
HKBU Classroom: Any other things, and then we can get output.

417
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.629
HKBU Classroom: And I hope you can see this is a very powerful approach.

418
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.939
HKBU Classroom: Much more powerful than just… go-to poll, or…

419
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:58.790
HKBU Classroom: a GUI to talk to a chatbot.

420
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.530
HKBU Classroom: Well, that's an obsolete way of using AI.

421
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:04.389
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean?

422
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.720
HKBU Classroom: I mean, it's a smart decision for OpenAI to

423
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:14.720
HKBU Classroom: to introduce ChatGPT to the world using a GUI, using a chat interface.

424
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:24.540
HKBU Classroom: Because the threshold is very low. Everybody can just start talking, start typing, start and experience the amazing power of AI.

425
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.270
HKBU Classroom: But that's not the best way to use AI.

426
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.960
HKBU Classroom: This is much better.

427
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:34.539
HKBU Classroom: But not everybody can learn how to use this.

428
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.730
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean?

429
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:43.589
HKBU Classroom: So let's, let's, let's take some time to…

430
00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:46.790
HKBU Classroom: Make sure that everybody's on the same page, because

431
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:53.189
HKBU Classroom: Frankly speaking, I think the rest of the time is just… Up to you now.

432
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:55.660
HKBU Classroom: You see what I mean?

433
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:10.120
HKBU Classroom: So, my suggestion would be everybody try this, okay? So, you delete the sample folder.

434
00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:17.660
HKBU Classroom: And, you write a student reflection markdown to fill it with your own case.

435
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:28.790
HKBU Classroom: And then you update this, Mapping instruction with your… file folder.

436
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:34.649
HKBU Classroom: And then send the file path to the agent, And see how it goes.

437
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.470
HKBU Classroom: And, once you see the results.

438
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.790
HKBU Classroom: You can then… we can have a little bit of discussion.

439
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.420
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

440
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:51.819
HKBU Classroom: you know, To what extent do you think it might be a useful or relevant approach?

441
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:58.030
HKBU Classroom: That's the first question. The second question is, how can we apply this approach to your research and writing?

442
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.189
HKBU Classroom: When we change the input, change the process prompt.

443
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:05.470
HKBU Classroom: We might be able to get something Different.

444
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.940
HKBU Classroom: So let's,

445
00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:18.060
HKBU Classroom: Let's take a break. I mean, you guys can work on this a little bit, and then we can come back.

446
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.389
HKBU Classroom: And we can, Discuss.

447
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:09.790
HKBU Classroom: Right, so, so actually, the pass, I think it should be used the relative pass instead of

448
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.649
HKBU Classroom: The whole path, okay?

449
00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:21.869
HKBU Classroom: But I think the AI is smart enough to… to kind of… Figure things out.

450
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.560
HKBU Classroom: Alright, so, any question?

451
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:53.059
HKBU Classroom: training data is very ungeneral, the transport has been unpowerful, then it's how the context is bloated.

452
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:22.279
HKBU Classroom: Take a file, let me show your…

453
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.150
HKBU Classroom: strengths or weaknesses.

454
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.420
HKBU Classroom: Divide.

455
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:51.630
HKBU Classroom: You know, you work with me, right? You need to know more about me, so you bought all the info, you found that Indiana.

456
00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:00.279
HKBU Classroom: What kind of your prompt?

457
00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:07.040
HKBU Classroom: No, just, given the information about developer plan, blah blah blah.

458
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:23.760
HKBU Classroom: No, this is what she needed, but fuck it, darn, you could just copy and paste, file AI agent, it's okay, no, you on the file path.

459
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:29.010
HKBU Classroom: copy and paste.

460
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:33.670
HKBU Classroom: Event horseshoe.

461
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.660
HKBU Classroom: Your computer science majors!

462
00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.550
HKBU Classroom: My den, Ali.

463
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:20.320
HKBU Classroom: Oh, okay.

464
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.590
HKBU Classroom: Deva.

465
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:46.639
HKBU Classroom: Jesus… If file passes your copy and paste mail attributed.

466
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:56.580
HKBU Classroom: Don Isaba.

467
00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.950
HKBU Classroom: No, isma.

468
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:36.300
HKBU Classroom: copy and paste, but the file path agent.

469
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.540
HKBU Classroom: Don Isaba.

470
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.320
HKBU Classroom: So, ho…

471
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:57.999
HKBU Classroom: Cursed as well.

472
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.600
HKBU Classroom: Joseon.

473
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:17.509
HKBU Classroom: copy and paste the trivia.

474
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.920
HKBU Classroom: Su Dai Yu.

475
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.920
HKBU Classroom: Oh, shoot.

476
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.529
HKBU Classroom: the eager follow-up.

477
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:31.420
HKBU Classroom: How many of you are doing, actually doing this research related to a large language model?

478
00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:32.720
HKBU Classroom: Raise your hand.

479
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.950
HKBU Classroom: a condo.

480
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.140
HKBU Classroom: Raise your hand.

481
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.530
HKBU Classroom: Yo, it was a summarization behind it somewhere.

482
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.040
HKBU Classroom: Mel Geda.

483
00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:53.130
HKBU Classroom: Anyway… So I think Andy and, Ethan.

484
00:50:53.300 --> 00:51:00.769
HKBU Classroom: Even harder to hear you anyway.

485
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:07.469
HKBU Classroom: MCPR, who calling

486
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:09.020
HKBU Classroom: Daniel Zo…

487
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.989
HKBU Classroom: Beholder to Hitsuya.

488
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.420
HKBU Classroom: Goodbye.

489
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.420
HKBU Classroom: O men bimpimbunang go.

490
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.429
HKBU Classroom: Tongue APIs, you caught up.

491
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.480
HKBU Classroom: Behold Zuya. Am I right?

492
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:29.480
HKBU Classroom: Huh?

493
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.520
Kaitai: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

494
00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.130
HKBU Classroom: Oh.

495
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:46.470
Kaitai: Ning, international?

496
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.700
HKBU Classroom: Thank you.

497
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:10.180
Kaitai: Buh.

498
00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.709
HKBU Classroom: na pushao, yung… To her country.

499
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:29.130
Kaitai: far, Tongo API, far… to co-pilot.

500
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:30.590
HKBU Classroom: So, if I'm an agent.

501
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.430
Kaitai: Fuck Agent. Agent even military API, but…

502
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:37.810
Kaitai: You know what I do, Cody.

503
00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:38.830
HKBU Classroom: That's the point.

504
00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.480
HKBU Classroom: That's… that's my… that's the reason why…

505
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.220
HKBU Classroom: I think in the long term, we have to get rid of this.

506
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:46.900
HKBU Classroom: Donisma.

507
00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:48.410
Kaitai: Okay.

508
00:52:55.010 --> 00:53:09.450
HKBU Classroom: Well, actually, you could potentially… Am I right?

509
00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:13.630
Kaitai: Legal folder.

510
00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:16.970
HKBU Classroom: So he doesn't want this,

511
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:25.409
HKBU Classroom: Anyway… Well, this is something we need to… we need to think a bit more, okay?

512
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.420
HKBU Classroom: How… Active 1.1 immunity?

513
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:41.790
HKBU Classroom: Can you, can you share… anyone share?

514
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.670
HKBU Classroom: The output with us, or with me?

515
00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:51.360
HKBU Classroom: I think, I think there are a couple ways to do this. One is actually to, issue a pull request.

516
00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.650
HKBU Classroom: To share the, the, the output.

517
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:09.810
HKBU Classroom: So I need… Okay.

518
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:19.510
HKBU Classroom: So I think it would be nice if each of you can actually share with me, you know, the process, the output.

519
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:21.260
HKBU Classroom: And see how it goes.

520
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:37.069
HKBU Classroom: Now, I want to very quickly, talk about Activity 1.2.

521
00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.820
HKBU Classroom: So, this is… again, I used the same… same format.

522
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.570
HKBU Classroom: I have some sample notes.

523
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:06.920
HKBU Classroom: Well, actually, it all starts with here, review mat, okay?

524
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.970
HKBU Classroom: So what is review mat?

525
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:19.970
HKBU Classroom: Are you… are you all on this note? Review mat? So it's review materials.

526
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:30.140
HKBU Classroom: And, here I said, given the focus on macro-level structure review, this… materials…

527
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.809
HKBU Classroom: So there's, Session 1 and Session 2 handout.

528
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:39.569
HKBU Classroom: So these materials come from, from here.

529
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:44.780
HKBU Classroom: From here.

530
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:52.529
HKBU Classroom: Okay? So, so we have… Session 1… So there's some materials here.

531
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:58.360
HKBU Classroom: And we have session 2… Materials are here, so this is the materials from the course team.

532
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.060
HKBU Classroom: And then…

533
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:25.159
HKBU Classroom: I tell the chapel, you know, the AI, our main concern is how to organize a research article at macro level, how to select different ideas and contents to present in each section and subsession, and how these sessions and subsession should be linked logically.

534
00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:29.299
HKBU Classroom: So I asked the, agent to create a new note.

535
00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:41.200
HKBU Classroom: called macronotes.mb, take into account the handout and materials above, and write new and concise notes with actionable insights on how to organize a paper.

536
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:46.569
HKBU Classroom: We need advice that is useful for this assignment.

537
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:56.479
HKBU Classroom: We also need tips and instructions for analyzing and annotating the published papers to further enrich our knowledge on this issue in specific fields and subfields.

538
00:56:57.590 --> 00:57:00.679
HKBU Classroom: And the output is to create a sample note.

539
00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:02.289
HKBU Classroom: In the same folder.

540
00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:06.870
HKBU Classroom: So I sent this to AI, the agent, and…

541
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.170
HKBU Classroom: The agent prepared these macro notes for me.

542
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.529
HKBU Classroom: And then, I, move on.

543
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:22.520
HKBU Classroom: to this… Analyze paper, one instruction.

544
00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:27.510
HKBU Classroom: And they said, oh, look at this sample nodes as the input.

545
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:36.219
HKBU Classroom: And then look at, this paper from, from, you know, kala.md, it's from, Zhu Tongxue.

546
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

547
00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:42.090
HKBU Classroom: So, explore how we could annotate and analyze this paper, blah blah blah blah.

548
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:47.420
HKBU Classroom: Create a new file, Keller Insights, to present the results of the

549
00:57:48.820 --> 00:58:01.400
HKBU Classroom: Analysis, take notes on the specific features, and also generate the visualsample.html to visualize the macro-level structure of the paper. And when I send this to the AI agent.

550
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:08.340
HKBU Classroom: I got the Keller Insight, which is a page here, And also the HTML.

551
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.909
HKBU Classroom: Let me see if I can show this.

552
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:25.870
HKBU Classroom: Sorry.

553
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:32.849
HKBU Classroom: So, the easiest way to do this, because I'm in an online environment, is simply to download it, right?

554
00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.179
HKBU Classroom: So, if you're, you're on your,

555
00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.070
HKBU Classroom: Local computer, then you don't have to download.

556
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:46.370
HKBU Classroom: So this is the result of, an HTML file.

557
00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.450
HKBU Classroom: that, analyze the paper.

558
00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:54.619
HKBU Classroom: To show the macros… macro-level structure analysis.

559
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:11.300
HKBU Classroom: Okay, so that's, that's the second, activity.

560
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:19.480
HKBU Classroom: And in fact, I, I take your… paper.

561
00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:27.849
HKBU Classroom: So, for each… paper… I created a folder for each of you.

562
00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:31.689
HKBU Classroom: And I essentially use the same approach.

563
00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.490
HKBU Classroom: So you can see that, there's some…

564
00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.520
HKBU Classroom: A macro-level analysis that has been done.

565
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:41.039
HKBU Classroom: On your paper.

566
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.610
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

567
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:50.369
HKBU Classroom: But then, of course, there's some details like PDF,

568
00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.180
HKBU Classroom: We have to convert it into Markdown first.

569
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:57.200
HKBU Classroom: If you have a… a pre… reprint link.

570
00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:04.770
HKBU Classroom: we have to go to that link to fetch and download the HTML file. If you have LaTeX,

571
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.179
HKBU Classroom: Then we have to kind of write some scripts to read the LaTeX.

572
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:13.709
HKBU Classroom: turn into Markdown or whatever, or later it's machine-readable.

573
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:18.380
HKBU Classroom: And then eventually, we will generate some… analysis here.

574
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.120
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

575
01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.680
HKBU Classroom: So, that's the results.

576
01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:32.270
HKBU Classroom: we've got… Which you can find in the literature folder.

577
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.009
HKBU Classroom: So that's Activity 1.2.

578
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:51.110
HKBU Classroom: Now, activity, 1.3… is something that…

579
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.130
HKBU Classroom: It's a little bit more complicated.

580
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.990
HKBU Classroom: So, we can… we can take a quick look.

581
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:08.330
HKBU Classroom: So, here I said an ILM has executed the instructions here.

582
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:16.600
HKBU Classroom: Wait, sorry, it should be this one.

583
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:28.410
HKBU Classroom: So the idea is that, we use the API key, from HKBU.

584
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.739
HKBU Classroom: Anyone use the HKB Gen AI?

585
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:36.090
HKBU Classroom: Raise your hand if you use, PU's AI.

586
01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.700
HKBU Classroom: Even, you know, build AI.

587
01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:42.700
HKBU Classroom: API key.

588
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:44.440
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

589
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:51.000
HKBU Classroom: Cause, I think… ITO only opened the API key for science faculty students.

590
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:57.420
HKBU Classroom: Okay, so from other faculty, I have to write to them and give them a list, so they can…

591
01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:59.629
HKBU Classroom: offer the API key for them.

592
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:06.219
HKBU Classroom: Anyway, it's… it's resources, right? You should use them.

593
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:21.030
HKBU Classroom: take a API, nigga, I told the API, nigga, AI chiselism, there's another… Why not?

594
01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:37.489
HKBU Classroom: Anyway, document gator.

595
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.729
HKBU Classroom: generate an assessment report.

596
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:46.299
HKBU Classroom: to critically assess the AI's work, including this and this.

597
01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:50.570
HKBU Classroom: Offer advice on how to improve the analysis so students can gain more insights.

598
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:07.960
HKBU Classroom: assessment, download the process log.

599
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:12.700
HKBU Classroom: the whole… GPT Si.

600
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:14.660
HKBU Classroom: Oh, input preparation.

601
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.040
HKBU Classroom: you got API to request.

602
01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.319
HKBU Classroom: Oh, totally, if you had the execution.

603
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:34.230
HKBU Classroom: So, like, not all API response, also, like, a validation, or to, like, a visual sample, the HTML, like,

604
01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:37.950
HKBU Classroom: assessment, blah blah blah.

605
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.460
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

606
01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.340
HKBU Classroom: Yeah.

607
01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:47.899
HKBU Classroom: So that's Activity 1.3.

608
01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:51.270
HKBU Classroom: Which is kind of a little bit more advanced, because now…

609
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:57.110
HKBU Classroom: We are using the AI compute power from a…

610
01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.339
HKBU Classroom: an external source, through API key.

611
01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:02.290
HKBU Classroom: Not from the AI agent.

612
01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:04.940
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

613
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.380
HKBU Classroom: Okay?

614
01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.150
HKBU Classroom: AI agent penshin?

615
01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:25.679
HKBU Classroom: Okay? De files, I mean?

616
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:36.880
HKBU Classroom: This is the Diago source.

617
01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:39.160
HKBU Classroom: sauce!

618
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:46.320

619
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:52.329
HKBU Classroom: Holy shit, whatever, programming codes. Programming codes all y'all die.

620
01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:57.429
HKBU Classroom: need to document something. So it's a young woman that truly…

621
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:09.190
HKBU Classroom: That motion only.

622
01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:17.370

HKBU Classroom: Notebook LM, the TDAC, so the open notebook.

627
01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.500
HKBU Classroom: When you create your shop, you gotta open a notebook.

628
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.110
HKBU Classroom: open sourced.

629
01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.920
HKBU Classroom: Dubai.

630
01:05:55.270 --> 01:06:01.870

HKBU Classroom: Goodbye.

635
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:30.380
HKBU Classroom: Given to the silo.

636
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.590
HKBU Classroom: Now Hannah, how to assignment.

637
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.209
HKBU Classroom: Activity 1.1 or 1.2.

638
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.190
HKBU Classroom: Generate more ideas.

639
01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.730
HKBU Classroom: For 10 additional activities.

640
01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:55.970
HKBU Classroom: ideas.md, each idea should include objectives, input, process, output, how students can learn, and what additional insights may be gained, how teachers may contribute.

641
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:04.680
HKBU Classroom: Sugar additional ideas.

642
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.000
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

646
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.700
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

647
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:44.379
HKBU Classroom: 1.5 is more advanced. Actually, I, I asked AI to build an REG table.

648
01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.240
HKBU Classroom: Okay.

649
01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:49.009
HKBU Classroom: It's kind of a work in progress.

650
01:07:50.860 --> 01:08:00.050
HKBU Classroom: Because the thing is, only the HKBU API keys support embedding.

651
01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.880
Kaitai: No, pour laux.

652
01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.359
HKBU Classroom: That's just embeddima.

653
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:13.440
Kaitai: Good shot.

654
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:21.580

655
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:28.969
HKBU Classroom: I, I, I don't think I can do demo here, because I…

656
01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:33.250
HKBU Classroom: I could, but, depending on, what

657
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.639
HKBU Classroom: What do you want? What do you need?

658
01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:43.709
HKBU Classroom: Anyway, so that's the, that's the activity at 1.5.

659
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.880
HKBU Classroom: Any question?

660
01:08:52.550 --> 01:09:05.729
HKBU Classroom: Now… What we're going to do is to confirm our… Group… group formation.

661
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.430
HKBU Classroom: What is it?

662
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.150
HKBU Classroom: Tigga, take a…
