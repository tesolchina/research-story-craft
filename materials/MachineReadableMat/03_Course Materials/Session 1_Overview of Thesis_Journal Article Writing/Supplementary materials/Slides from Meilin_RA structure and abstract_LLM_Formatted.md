In this part:

1. You will discuss the format of research articles (RAs) in different disciplines.
2. You will study the structural and linguistic features of different sections of a research article (RA)  
   • Abstract
3. You will learn to compile a corpus of your own for future writing.

### Activity: Understanding the RA Structure Across Disciplines

1. Form a group of 2-3 students and look at the three different types of article structure in the Google Doc ([Weblink1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UpqFpERUSnzz7AAL8t1iZ4YeqqYu7U8Hfm0paiF_dpI/edit?usp=sharing)).
2. Compare them with the 10 RAs you downloaded. Do any of the structure types match that of the 10 RAs?  
   If none of the following types match the format of the RAs in your field, write down the major sections of the RA in your research field.
3. Share your findings with your group mates.

### Pre-activity Discussion

Form a group of 2-3 students and discuss the following questions:

1. Why is the abstract necessary for academic journals?
2. What is the usual word limit for an abstract?
3. What kind of information do you think should be included in an abstract?
4. Is there a structure for RA abstracts?

---

# Page 10

## RA Abstracts: Research Findings

**Researchers’ decision on reading RAs:**

1. Scholars only read 1/10 of the articles, the titles of which they have scanned.
2. They only read about 1/2 of the articles, the abstracts of which they have read.

**Abstracts:**

- Research paper writing: persuasion
- Promoting you and your paper
- Conferences, special issues: abstract first

### Activity: Analysing the Move Structure of Example Abstracts

1. Go to the Google Doc using Weblink2 in the email.
2. Read one of the example abstracts.
3. Discuss with the students next to you.  
   - Why did I make the first few words of each sentence **bold**?  
   - By just looking at the bolded phrases, can you tell what kind of information is given in each sentence?  
   - Why did I make certain phrases *italic*?

## The Move Structure of RA Abstracts

RA abstracts often follow the conventional IMRaD RA structure:

- **Move 1: Introduction**  
  *Why did you start?*  
  Explain the topic of the paper, relevant literature and current practice, and the purpose/aim of the current study.
- **Move 2: Methods**  
  *What did you do?*  
  Describe the research design, methods of data collection, etc.
- **Move 3: Results**  
  *What did you find?*  
  Present the MOST important findings and outcomes.
- **Move 4: Discussion/Conclusion**  
  *What does it mean?*  
  Point out implications of the findings for future policy or practice.

1. **Introduction (55%)**  
   Establishes context of the paper and motivates the research  
   *World Context; Research Context; Significance of Topic*
2. **Purpose**  
   Indicates purpose, outlines the aim behind the paper  
   *Description of Objectives; Research Questions*
3. **Method**  
   Provides information on design, procedures, data analysis, etc.

## Hartley & Betts (2009): Common Weaknesses in Abstracts in the Social Sciences

100 abstracts:

- Only 56% provide info on the background of the study
- Only 58% report participants’ age
- 36% report the number of participants
- 12% report participants’ sex
- 27% report where the study was carried out

---

# Page 17

## Structured Abstracts in Some Disciplines (e.g. Medicine)

Suggestion given by Hartley & Betts (2009):

- First write a structured abstract, then remove the headings to make it one paragraph
- 145 words
- Information score: 20 (out of 20)

### Activity: Analysing the Linguistic Features of RA Abstracts

1. Now look at the example abstracts in Weblink2 again.
2. Discuss with the students next to you.  
   What kind of phrases or sentence patterns are typical for each move?
   - Introduction
   - Purpose
   - Method
   - Product/Results

## An Example

This experiment tests the effect of choke type and gun selection on target accuracy in order to determine the best gun specifications. Three competent shooters of approximately equivalent marksmanship abilities tested three different choke types (full, modified, and improved) and two different guns (a Remington 11-87 semi-automatic and a Beretta 682 Gold E). With a confidence level of 95%, the gun selection ended up to be the only significant factor. The Beretta was found more accurate than the Remington possibly because the Beretta’s weight is centered in the middle of the gun while the Remington is a little barrel-heavy. However, if the confidence level is lowered to 90%, choke type is also significant, with the improved choke being more accurate than the modified or full. Thus, for target shooting, the most accurate combination would be the Beretta with an improved choke.

### Activity: Analysing the Linguistic Features of an Abstract: Summary

1. **A typical noun phrase to start describing the research objective/aim:**  
   the experiment, this study, this paper  
   You can also use other things such as a pronoun (we) or prepositional phrases (in this paper, …)
2. **Frequent use of adjectives/modifiers to describe the research accurately:**  
   the best, approximately equivalent, most accurate, also significant, etc.
3. **Different verb tenses for different purposes:**  
   - present tense (the experiment tests): research objective  
   - past tense (tested 3 different choke types): method  
   - present + past tenses (ended up, was found, is centred, is lowered): results
4. **Passive + active voices to diversify the language:**  
   ended up, was found, is centred, is lowered
5. **Connectives to achieve better coherence and cohesion:**  
   because, while, however, thus, etc.
6. **Modal verbs to soften the tone:**  
   would be
7. **Prepositional phrases instead of relative clauses to add more information:**  
   with the improved choke being more accurate, with an improved choke

## RA Abstracts: Another Example

Have a look at the last example in the Google Doc of Weblink2. Do you think this abstract is well written?

# Page 22

We examine whether conservative white males are more likely than are other adults in the U.S. general public to endorse climate change denial. We draw theoretical and analytical guidance from the identity protective cognition thesis explaining the white male effect and from recent political psychology scholarship documenting the heightened system-justification tendencies of political conservatives. We utilize public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from 2001 to 2010, focusing specifically on five indicators of climate change denial. We find that conservative white males are significantly more likely than are other Americans to endorse denialist views on all five items, and that these differences are even greater for those conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming very well. Furthermore, the results of our multivariate logistic regression models reveal that the conservative white male effect remains significant when controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender as well as the effects of nine control variables. We thus conclude that the unique views of conservative white males contribute significantly to the high level of climate change denial in the United States.

### Activity: Analysing the Move Structure and the Linguistic Features of an RA Abstract in Your Own Field

1. Download one or two RAs that you think are well-written in your own field. You can use RAs from the 10 you submitted.
2. Open Weblink4 and find your name in the Google Doc.
3. Following the steps that you have been through with the Example Abstracts, highlight different parts of the abstract and identify the moves used in each part. If you find any part in your abstract that does not match any of the moves given in the IMRaD or the IPMPrC model, write down the function you think this part fulfils.
4. Then, identify typical words/phrases and grammatical patterns that are used in the abstract. Pay attention to the moves/steps these words/phrases and grammatical pattern fulfil.

### Activity 2-5: Reflection on Language Re-use

Form a group of 2-3 students and discuss the following questions:

1. Before this course, did you notice any of the move-structure or linguistic features of RA abstracts we have discussed?
2. Which usages (e.g. phrases, sentence patterns) do you think you will use in your writing?
