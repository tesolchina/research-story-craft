*Retrieved from: [https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/sites/default/files/Oral_presentation%20s_signalling_2014_Accessible.pdf](https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/sites/default/files/Oral_presentation%20s_signalling_2014_Accessible.pdf)*

In an oral presentation, you need to make the topic clear to your audience, identify the main sections of your talk, and link in your ideas and information so that the presentation flows. This can be done with the use of signalling or transition words, which show your audience how the presentation is structured and how ideas relate to each other. This is a form of signposting that creates a path through your discussion, to show your audience how everything fits together.
