## Writing the Conclusion Section

The conclusion section of a research paper is a crucial component that ties together the main findings and implications of your work. It serves as the final opportunity to reinforce your research's significance, offering a concise summary of key insights and their relevance to the field. A well-crafted conclusion not only synthesizes the main arguments but also highlights the broader impact of your research, suggesting avenues for future study and inviting further exploration of the topic. Mastering this section enhances the overall coherence of your paper and leaves a lasting impression on your readers.

---

### Warm-up Task

Find a partner and discuss the following questions:

1. What are the functions of the Conclusion section of a thesis and a journal article?  
2. What should be avoided in the Conclusion section of a thesis and a journal article?  

---

# Task 1

Read and comment on the following two examples of the Conclusion section. Are they effective? Why/why not?

The abstracts below give you some ideas about the research.

---

#### Example 1

**Abstract**  
This article provides an overview of language learning strategies (LLS) for second and foreign language (L2/FL) teachers. To do so it outlines the background of LLS and LLS training, discusses a three step approach teachers may follow in using LLS in their classes, and summarises key reflections and questions for future research on this aspect of L2/FL education.

**Conclusion**  
This paper has provided a brief overview of LLS by examining their background and summarising the relevant literature. It has also outlined some ways that LLS training has been used and offered a three step approach for teachers to consider in implementing it within their own L2/FL classes. It has also raised two important issues, posed questions for further LLS research, and noted a number of contacts that readers may use in networking on LLS in L2/FL education. In my experience, using LLS and LLS training in the L2/FL class not only encourages learners in their language learning but also helps teachers reflect on and improve their teaching. Many readers also find this to be the case.

#### Example 2

**Abstract**  
International management studies have been based primarily on the comparison of managerial behavior in countries around the world. Often, these studies have implied that business people behave similarly with their domestic colleagues as with their foreign counterparts. In questioning that assumption, this study tests whether intra-cultural behavior accurately predicts cross-cultural behavior. Using a negotiation simulation and a sample of 462 Japanese, American and Canadian businesspeople, behaviors in cross-cultural negotiations were found to differ in some important ways from those in intra-cultural negotiations.

**Conclusion**  
[Para.1] Concisely stated, the central question of the study has been: Are negotiation processes and outcomes the same in cross-cultural interactions as in intra-cultural interactions? The study has considered six important negotiation constructs and tested for variation using four distinct cultural groups. Changes in behavior and outcomes have been observed in seven out of the twenty-four possible instances. The overall conclusion of the study therefore must be that negotiations do indeed adapt their behavior in cross-cultural interactions.

[Para.2] The literature in cross-cultural communication indicates that cross-cultural negotiations will be more difficult than intra-cultural negotiations. Furthermore, research on reciprocity and interactional synchrony suggests that negotiators will imitate or reflect one another’s behaviors and thereby adapt to differing cultural situations. In two cases, such views are supported. There is only one finding that cannot be explained by established theory and that is why the Japanese negotiators were more attracted to Americans than they were to their fellow Japanese. It is conceivable that the phenomena appear to be more complex than our simple approach warrants.

[Para.3] It is important to be aware of the limitations and shortcomings of the research design. Perhaps the most important consideration is the validity of the principal outcome measure, individual profits. Any laboratory experiment is open to criticism and this research is no exception. Additionally, much of the evidence supplied for accepting or rejecting hypotheses derives from participants’ self-reports and judgments, which in turn depend on memory and impressions. Future studies should include improvements in both these areas. The help of foreign researchers and the use of more inductive methods in foreign cultures will be needed to mitigate such limitations.

# Task 3

## Language Features of the Conclusion Section

Read the following example of the Conclusion section taken from a journal article in the field of Clinical Psychology. The abstract gives you some ideas about the research. Analyze the language features (e.g. tense, sentence structure, voice, and hedging language) of the Conclusion Section. Report your findings to a partner.

**Abstract**  
Parkinson's disease (PD) is often associated with depression and anxiety. The availability of evidence-based psychological interventions is low. This pilot study investigates the feasibility and preliminary effect of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for depression and anxiety in PD. Nine patients with PD with comorbid symptoms on the relevant subscale of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), of either depression (HADS-D > 7) or anxiety (HADS-A > 7) received 12 weeks of ICBT, specially adapted for depression and anxiety in PD. Primary outcome was change in depression and anxiety symptoms, measured with HADS total score. Effects on non-motor symptoms, PD specific health and quality of life and insomnia were explored, plus the participant's involvement, satisfaction, and subjective evaluation of the treatment. Participants reported lower symptoms on HADS after ICBT (Cohen's d = 0.79, p < 0.05). However, levels of inactivity were rather high and questionnaires and comments from participants suggested that the treatment can be improved, for example by adding more therapist support. The results suggest that ICBT could be a feasible way to alleviate depression and anxiety in PD. However, a somewhat simplified treatment and different ways to provide support to enhance adherence and outcome are warranted.

**Conclusion**  
This study investigated the feasibility and effect of ICBT for depression and anxiety in PD. The ICBT tested in the study was based on behavioral activation for depression and optional symptom specific modules were matched to each participant's needs. The results suggest that this form of ICBT can be effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms in PD. ICBT was associated with a significant drop in HADS with a medium to large within group effect, especially in the depressive symptoms sub-scale HADS-D. No significant effects were seen on anxiety symptoms measured with the sub-scale HADS-A, or the secondary outcomes of insomnia, PD related health and quality of life, depressive symptoms measured with MADRS-S, or non-motor symptoms. The treatment might be a cost effective treatment alternative since the therapist spent less than 15 min per participant and week, which is less than seen in previous face-to-face or telephone-CBT (Dobkin et al., 2011a and Dobkin et al., 2011b).

Strengths of this study include the novelty of using an internet based treatment on PD patients which is an often neglected group when it comes to psychological treatments, the large number of questionnaire and interview data measuring the participant's interaction and satisfaction with treatment, and the significant effect on the main outcome. Internet based treatments have earlier rarely been used with patient groups with a high degree of functional impairment. The preliminary results indicating comparably low degrees of participant satisfaction and involvement could be used as a warning not to assume that the adaptations made in this treatment program were sufficient.

This study also displays limitations. First, since this was a pilot study without a control condition, any detected effect could be caused by non-specific treatment factors such as time and the attention of a therapist. Thus, the findings in this feasibility study need to be replicated in a randomized controlled trial. Second, the small sample size makes the study underpowered, leading to difficulty detecting treatment effects. Third, there was no significant drop in depressive symptoms measured with MADRS-S similar to the drop in HADS-D. Fourth, only one psychologist (MK) treated the participants leading to difficulties generalizing the results to other therapists. Fifth, the participants were recruited by a single neurologist (PS) and may not be generalizable to the whole population of people with depression and anxiety in PD. The high degree of non-motor symptoms may for example be an indication that the participants were unusually symptomatic in this sample. Finally, since assessors were not blinded to time point, there could be a bias towards describing improvements in the participants.

Implications for future studies of internet-based treatment for depression and anxiety in PD include the need to adapt the treatment protocol to the patient group even further. The qualitative evaluation regarding adherence and drop out implies that the technological aspects of treatment easily can become a hurdle for this patient group. The internet platform needs to be simple enough for the participants to use, and the interaction between participants and therapist needs to be active to ensure participant involvement in treatment. Additionally, the engagement of a caregiver could motivate the participant to work with the treatment assignments.

ICBT for depression and anxiety in PD could be a time saving and accessible alternative. The results are encouraging in that ICBT had effect on depressive symptoms; however, further adaptations of the ICBT program, the type of therapeutic support, and technical platform could probably improve the participants' involvement in treatment and satisfaction. More feasibility trials of ICBT in different forms, as well as larger randomized-controlled trials, with long term follow-up data, are warranted to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy of ICBT for this group of patients.

# Task 4

## Highlighting the Significance of the Research

One of the important moves in the Conclusion section is to highlight the significance of the research. There are a number of ways to do this:

1. **Highlight the contributions** of your research (new knowledge discovered) which may be methodological, theoretical, empirical, pedagogical contributions or potential applications of the new findings.
2. If your research is pioneering in the field, you should **emphasize the novelty** in the conclusion and suggest how future research can build upon the findings of your study.
3. If your research builds on the findings of previous studies, you can **highlight how your research findings are similar or different from previous research** (e.g. whether your research findings confirm/support or refute the findings of previous studies; what additional evidence is provided?)

---

Read the following excerpts taken from the Conclusion sections of three different research articles in the fields of Chemistry, Visual Arts and Computer Science. How did the author(s) highlight the significance of their research? Underline the expressions that were used to emphasize the significance of the research.

---

### Excerpt 1 (Chemistry)

The proposed CMCPEs electrodes based on the single ion-exchanger (ATS-DAUH) and ion-exchanger (ATS-PC) as the electroactive materials **might be useful detectors and interesting alternative methods** for the determination of [ATS] in different real samples. The present electrodes **show high sensitivity, reasonable selectivity, fast static response, long-term stability and applicability over a wide pH range with minimal sample pretreatment**. The presented methods for the determination of atorvastatin calcium with the prescribed electrodes are **simple, sensitive, highly specific and advantageous over the previously described procedures for ATS determinations**.

### Excerpt 2 (Visual Arts)

Rather than understanding VR’s capacity to shape emotion as limited to what goes on inside the device itself, **I have argued here for a broader understanding of the VR empathy machine**, including VR fictions, journalism, and other conduits for the heightened feelings surrounding the technology. **This broader perspective reveals how the VR industry’s most sustained empathetic investments (the strongest concerns for someone else’s well-being, positive or negative) are aimed not at those serving as the subject of any particular VR experience, but rather at the game-master figures who serve as symbolic targets for popular emotions surrounding the technology** …

Rather than seek to build a wider range of ‘empathy simulators’ (to go back to Yang’s term, 2017), **the reworked understanding of the VR empathy machine presented here suggests the most powerful nodes for shaping VR empathy are VR developers themselves and the stories popularly told about them**. **Whoever controls the narrative not just in VR but about VR will have the capacity to channel emotions surrounding the technology**. **Much can be gained from a clearer understanding of the mechanisms by which some are centered and some are marginalized by the current emotional pathways of the VR empathy machine, including negative empathy, and I have sought to contribute to that mapping here**.

### Excerpt 3 (Computer Science)

**We have presented new methods based on EVM to compute length measurements, sphericity and roundness of 3D objects represented as binary volume datasets …**

**We have proposed a new EVM-based roundness index. The method to compute it is based on the ray-tracing paradigm and uses the vertices of the EVM representation. Besides, the time to compute the proposed index is also more than an order of magnitude faster compared with previous VXM-based methods, which depend on the surface area computation …**

# Task 8

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. It is a commonly used technique for presenting research results in research writing and presentations. By using data visualization tools such as charts, tables, graphs, and maps, it will be easier for both technical and non-technical audiences to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

## Steps for Explaining Data Visualization in an Academic Presentation

1. Tell the audience what the visual is about  
2. Guide the audience to read and understand the visual in a particular sequence according to your intended purpose  
3. Highlight the significant aspects which are worth noting when interpreting the data  
4. Explain the significance/meaning of the data (What do the data show?)  

---

### Useful Phrases for Explaining Data Visualization in an Academic Presentation

| Tell the audience what the visual is about | Guide the audience to read and understand the visual in a particular sequence according to your intended purpose | Highlight the significant aspects which are worth noting when interpreting the data | Explain the significance/meaning of the data |

Below is an example of good data visualization and the explanation of the visual.

**Source of the visual:** [https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-50-most-visited-websites-in-the-world/](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-50-most-visited-websites-in-the-world/)

**An example showing how the visual can be explained to the audience in a presentation:**

> **[Step 1]** Let’s turn to this diagram which shows the world’s most popular websites as of November 2020.  
> **[Step 2]** The bar chart at the top left shows a breakdown of websites by categories. Here you can see the global rank of the website at the top of the circle, and the circle size is based on monthly traffic volume.  
> **[Step 3]** It is clear that Google, YouTube and Facebook are the top three most visited websites. What’s more, as the pandemic transformed the way we work, learn, communicate and shop, a majority of these activities migrated online. For example, it is not surprising that Zoom has grown explosively, with its number of monthly visitors surpassing Netflix, LinkedIn and Reddit.  
> **[Step 4]** Overall, the data provide evidence to support the argument that social media and news have become part of everyday life of a majority of people worldwide. The data presented gives insight into the industries in which these sites operate and the traffic they attract.

## OPTIONAL TASK - Supplementary Information on Visual Aids for Academic Presentations (Paper Presentations and Poster Presentations)

Effective use of visual aids can enhance your presentations. They can increase the audience’s understanding of your topic, make an impact and engage the audience. Visual aids are chosen depending on their purpose. In an academic presentation, PowerPoint slides are always used. The following tasks give you some suggestions about the choice of colouring and typographical features in academic presentations.

---

### Colouring

1. Have a look at the four example PPT slides below. Which two slides do you find easier to read? Why?

---

There are three effective ways of using multiple colours:

1.  
2.  
3.  

---

#### Choosing Background Colours

The colours you choose for your foreground and background should be as far apart in value as possible to maximize visibility.  
To test various foreground/background combinations, convert your colours to grayscale. The more your two colours approach the values of black and white, the greater the contrast and the clearer your message.

---

#### Using Colours to Highlight

When there is too much information in a slide and you would like to draw the audience attention to certain points, you can use colours to highlight those you will talk about.

---

Which colour in each diagram do you see immediately?

When multiple colours are present, the audience will tend to see warm colours first.

---

# Typographical Features

Which slides are easier to read, those on the left or right?

- **Rule 1:** Never use a single bullet  
- **Rule 2:** Don’t write wordy bullet items

Which slides are easier to read, those on the left or right?

- **Rule 3:** Increase the spacing  
- **Rule 4:** Indent the text

---

Which font do you prefer, Serif or Sans Serif? Why?

i. Sans serif fonts are usually perceived as simple or pure. They are easier to see from a distance. They are best for slide and poster presentations.

ii. Serif fonts convey tone and personality and are good for smaller character sizes (10–14 pts) in multiple lines of type.

iii. Some sans serif fonts convey a bit more personality than others. They are more playful and can make a presentation seem less standard or routine.

iv. Non-proportional (or “monospaced”) fonts are those with each character having the same width. They catch people’s attention easily and are best used in isolation, such as in title slides, flyers.

---

## Formatting Fonts: Using the Slide Master

1. Click on “View”  
2. Then click on “Slide Master”  
3. Now click on “Home” to change the font format  

---

After you have finished formatting the fonts, click on “Slide Master” and then click “Close Master View” to go back to the slides.

---

### Formatting Consistency across Platforms

If you use MS PowerPoint on Mac, select Windows-compatible fonts.

If possible, always check on the computer in the room where you are going to present before the presentation.
