## Slide 3

### Task 1

Watch the following video from 0:00-2:08 to see why they are so important:

While watching the video, take notes for the following questions:

---

## Slide 4

2. **Which words in a sentence are often stressed?**  
While speaking, stress and intonation are used to make the important content of your talk clear. Often there is a rise in intonation on a keyword, but sometimes there is a fall especially at the end of sentences.

3. **What is the most important thing in achieving good intonation?**  
Without appropriate stress and intonation, your listeners may miss the point you're trying to make. What’s worse, you may end up sounding like a robot.

4. **Without proper stress and intonation when you talk, how will your listeners feel?**  
The important thing is that there is a contrast in intonation with the words that surround the one you want to stress.

- **Stress** is the emphasis given to a syllable in a word or words within a sentence and usually involves an increase in volume and a change in intonation.
- **Intonation** is the way the voice goes up or down.

**What is stress? What is intonation?**

---

## Slide 5

### Task 2

Watch the first two minutes of the following presentation video. How do you think the speaker has used stress and intonation effectively to convey meaning?  
**Hany Farid: How to spot fake AI photos | TED Talk**

- Identify some examples of stressed words in the talk.
- Why do you think the speaker stresses these words? What characteristics do these words share?
- In what ways do stress and intonation enhance the meaning conveyed during the talk?

Those words carry important meaning, helping listeners grasp the main ideas.

- Clarifying meaning
- Expressing emotions and attitudes
- Maintaining listener interest
- Signaling confidence and control
- Organizing information

## Slide 6

### Giving a Three-Minute-Thesis Presentation

In a Three-Minute Thesis (3MT) presentation, effectively communicating your research story is essential for engaging your audience and conveying the significance of your work. This skill involves distilling complex ideas into clear, concise narratives that highlight key findings and their implications. Postgraduates must learn to structure their presentations logically, employing skills such as creating a strong opening hook to capture attention, using vivid language and relatable examples to clarify concepts, and incorporating visual aids to enhance understanding. Additionally, mastering body language and vocal variety can help maintain audience interest. By honing these skills, researchers can make their presentations more compelling and accessible, ultimately inspiring interest and dialogue around their work.

## Slide 7

### Task 3

Watch a three-minute thesis video from the Graduate School, Stony Brook University:  
**SBU Three Minute Thesis 2019: Olivia Swanson, 1st Place - YouTube**

Use the following questions to help you analyze the video:

- How does the speaker organize the talk (read the transcript on the next page)? What are the key moves?
- What strategies does the speaker use to explain abstract or technical concepts?
- What do you notice about the body language used by the speaker?
- What do you notice about the style/tone of a 3MT presentation?
- What do you think about the delivery skills of the speaker? What makes her a successful speaker?
- What transitional/signal phrases are used to connect ideas? Are they natural and economic (time-saving)?

### Task 4

Find a 3MT presentation video in your field of study (e.g., on YouTube or the University of Queensland's 3MT website: [Three Minute Thesis - University of Queensland](https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/)). Analyze the presentation using the guiding questions in Task 3.

## Slide 10

### Organisation of the 3MT

Five typical moves: orientation, rationale, purpose, methods and results (Jiang & Qiu, 2022):

1. Introduces the topic – grabbing the audience’s attention by providing surprising data, showing a visual, asking rhetorical questions, emphasizing the importance of the topic, etc.
2. Explains what is still unknown (the research/knowledge gap)
3. Explains the focus/objectives of your research
4. Briefly explains the methodology (if possible) and the preliminary results (if any)
5. Emphasises the potential contribution and the significance of the research.

---

## Slide 11

### Style/Tone

- A highly frequent use of first and second person pronouns ‘I’ and ‘you’ in 3MT presentations.
- It’s appropriate to use rhetorical questions to interact with the audience.
- It's important to use stress and intonation and hand gesture effectively to convey messages.

> “Hard sciences make more use of stance expressions, especially attitude markers which highlight the importance and surprise value of research findings, because research subjects in sciences are typically abstract beyond a common sense of nature and this heightened persuasive interaction oils the wheels of communicating scientific knowledge to a wide audience. In contrast, the fluid and disputable nature of soft knowledge necessitates dialogic involvement, so presenters in the soft disciplines posed more rhetorical questions” (Qiu & Jiang, 2021).

## Slide 12

### Attitudinal Dimension

How 3MT presenters project themselves and convey their judgments, opinions and commitments:

- **Hedges** allow speakers to withhold complete commitment to a proposition and open a discursive space with listeners’ disputation, such as *might* and *could*.
- **Boosters** help speakers present their work with assurance and shut down alternative voices, such as *in fact* and *must*.
- **Attitude markers** express speakers’ affective attitudes to propositions, conveying surprise, agreement, appreciation and so on, such as *good* and *fascinating*.
- **Self mention** marks speakers’ overt visibility and ownership to their contributions, such as *I* and *my*.

---

## Slide 13

### Engaging the Audience

In addition, four categories of engagement are examined for the ways presenters rhetorically focus the listeners’ attention and pull them along with their argument:

- **Listener mention** brings listeners into the on-going speech, normally through second person pronouns and inclusive first-person pronouns, such as *you* and *your*.
- **Directives** are instructions to the listeners, mainly expressed through imperatives and obligation modals, such as *consider* and *it’s important to note*.
- **Questions** invite direct collusion by addressing the listeners as having an interest in an issue and a willingness to follow the speakers’ argument, such as *And may I ask you a question?*
- **Appeals to shared knowledge** are signals asking listeners to recognize something as familiar or accepted, such as *obviously* and *normally*.
