## Slide 2

In this Session,
You will be introduced to three types of non-empirical papers:

Theory Papers
Conceptual articles
Opinion Articles

## Slide 3

Before start writing a nonempirical paper:
Do I want to publish in a journal that is primarily theoretical and conceptual, or do I want to include it in a journal with broader inclusion of article types? 
What audience do I want to inﬂuence? 
What is my purpose for writing this article? 
What journals are interested in the content matter of my article? 
What journals do I most often cite in my article? 
Do I want fast turnaround, or am I willing to wait longer? Some journals take very long for the referee process; others are much faster.  
Where do leaders in my ﬁeld publish?

Writing Theory Papers

## Slide 5

Theory building:

Theory building: “the purposeful process or recurring cycle by which coherent descriptions, explanations, and representations of observed or experienced phenomena are generated, veriﬁed, and reﬁned ” 
(Lynham, 2000a: 161)

## Slide 6

Theory papers in HRD:
Human Resource Development Review (the theory journal for the Academy of HRD): 
“Such papers may include syntheses of existing bodies of theory, new substantive theories, exploratory conceptual models, taxonomies and typology developed as foundations for theory, treatises in formal theory construction, papers on the history of theory, critique of theory that includes alternative research propositions, metatheory, and integrative literature reviews with strong theoretical implications. Papers addressing foundations of HRD might address philosophies of HRD, historical foundations, deﬁnitions ofthe ﬁeld, conceptual organization of the ﬁeld, and ethical foundations.”
(Torraco, 2005b)

treatise: [n] a formal piece of writing that considers and examines a particular subject

## Slide 7

Structure of a theory paper:
Conceptual development 
Operationalization 
Application 
Conﬁrmation or disconﬁrmation  
Continuous reﬁnement and development (of the theory) 
(Lynham, 2002b: 229)

## Slide 8

Guidelines for developing good theory:
The theorist should have substantial knowledge about the two domains for theory building. 
Knowledge of the elements of theory and of the process of developing new theoretical knowledge (i.e., knowledge of theory building) 
Deep conceptual understanding and practical knowledge (knowledge from experience) of the phenomenon or topic to be modeled by the theory 
The theory should be based on the clear speciﬁcation of the problem or the need for theory building. 
The research should demonstrate explicitly the logic and theoretical reasoning used by the theorist to link the research problem with the theoretical outcome (e.g., the theory or model). 
The work should propose and discuss research propositions, questions, or hypotheses for further theoretical and empirical study of the phenomenon modeled by the theory
(Torraco, 2005a: 364)

## Slide 9

Examples of theory papers:
McLean (2004) conceptualized the meaning of NHRD (National Human Resource Development) based on previous research on the concept and then developed the operationalization and implementation of the concept through thirteen case studies. 
Cho and McLean (2004): the process of McLean’s (2004) operationalization and implementation indicates that there appeared to be at least ﬁve tentative models for NHRD. 
Lynham, Paprock, and Cunningham (2006) extended the exploration into the theory of NHRD with a focus on NHRD solely on transitioning societies. 
Wang and Swanson (2008a), taking exception to the broadening deﬁnition of HRD, critiqued the concept of NHRD as being inadequately based on good theory and used an economics paradigm to refute the theories and models that were evolving.

## Slide 11

Conceptualisation:
Concepts: “ the elements of theory that are common to all research methods”                                                                         (Torraco, 2005a: 352)
Generally, a concept is more focused than a theory, as it is often a component of a theory.
Conceptualisation: the ﬁrst step in developing a theory 
(Lynham, 2002b)
Conceptual articles also bridge to opinion articles, because such articles may also include well-informed opinions.

## Slide 12

Differences between theory and conceptual papers:
Theory papers: after a theory is proposed, it should be put to the test.
Is it consistent with what we know from earlier research? 
Can the theory be supported empirically (quantitatively or qualitatively) by observation or measurement? 
What more do we need to know in order to move the theory forward? 
Conceptual articles: no need to test the concept.

## Slide 13

Tips for writing conceptual papers:
Keeping in mind the narrow focus of a concept, write solely on that concept. Do not pull in extraneous ideas. 
Take advantage of the foundations that others have established, and build on them. Use your own observations and experiences as you seek to extend a concept that others have established.  
As you present your concept, be clear and concrete in indicating how the concept can be applied in a practice setting

## Slide 14

Examples of conceptual papers:
Building on the work of Watkins and Marsick (1996), who built on the work of others on the concept of the learning organization, Tolbert, McLean, and Myers (2002) developed the concept of a global learning organization. 
The paper integrated concepts from the learning organization literature and literature on globalization, added the authors’ own experiences, and developed their concept of the global learning organization. 
The concept is not comprehensive enough to be considered a theory; they did not propose interactions or variables or test them at the time the article was published.

## Slide 15

Writing Opinion Articles

## Slide 16

Opinion articles:
Opinion articles are seldom referred, though they are usually reviewed by an editor who may require revisions.
Such articles may be published as editorials, as articles in non-referred sections of a journal (which may be labelled “Forum”), as letters to the editor, and even as book reviews. 
16

## Slide 17

Tips for writing opinion articles:
Avoid personal attacks. Keep the focus of the article on the ideas that are important to you. If you are critiquing others’ ideas, be sure you focus your criticisms on their ideas and not on them. 
Avoid making over-generalizations. Because these may be easily refuted, they weaken an argument or position. Keep your argument focused, and stick as close to facts as you can.  
Avoid being too vague, which can lead to misinterpretation of your position. 
Keep the article relatively short, perhaps only two or three pages when published. You increase the possibility of your article being read when readers can get your point fairly quickly. 
Humor, or at least a light touch, will also keep the readers interested. It also helps to make something that is deep and serious more likely to be read and may also inﬂuence others’ thinking. Some topics, of course, may require a serious approach.

## Slide 18

What you need to do
Find one RA in your field and go through the paper carefully.
Compare the three types of paper introduced in the PowerPoint (Theory, Conceptual, Opinion) and the RA in your field. Which type resembles the RA in your field most? Or is the RA in your field a combination of these papers?
Do you have a clear idea of the macrostructure of the RA in your field now?
Use the weblink in the email, go to No. 19, 20, 21 respectively and write down your analysis of the macrostructure of the RA you have chosen.
