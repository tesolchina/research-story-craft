Activity: Understanding the RA structure across disciplines1.Form a group of 2-3 students and a look at the three different types of article structure in the Google Doc (Weblink1).2.Compare them with the 10 RAs you downloaded. Do any of the structure type match that of the 10 RAs?If none of the following types match the format of the RAs in your field, write down the major sections of the RA in your research field. 3.Share your findings with your group mates4https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UpqFpERUSnzz7AAL8t1iZ4YeqqYu7U8Hfm0paiF_dpI/edit?usp=sharing

Pre-activity discussion:Form a group of 2-3 students and discuss the following questions.1)Why is the abstract necessary for academic journals?2)What is the usual word limit for an abstract?3)What kind of information do you think should be included in an abstract?4)Is there a structure for RA abstracts?9

RA abstracts:Research findings: researchers’ decision on reading RAs1)Scholars only read 1/10 of the articles, the titles of which they have scanned.2)They only read about 1/2 of the articles, the abstracts of which they have read.Abstracts:•Research paper writing: persuasion•Promoting you and your paper•Conferences, special issues: abstract first10

Activity: Analysing the move structure of example abstracts1)Go to the Google Doc using Weblink2in the email.2)Read one of the example abstracts3)Discuss with the students next to you. Why did I make the fist few words of each sentence bold?By just looking at the bolded phrases, can you tell what kind of information is given in each sentence?Why did I make certain phrases italic?11https://docs.google.com/document/d/14U5yKuM89HY27F58LNI9yvMu_dq_6ttLxuXjUzkZbQQ/edit?usp=sharing

The move structure of RA abstracts:RA abstracts often follows the conventional IMRaDRA structure:•Move 1: Introduction:Why did you start?Explain the topic of the paper, relevant literature and current practice, and the purpose/aim of the current study.•Move 2: Methods:What did you do?Describe the research design, methods of data collection, etc.•Move 3: Results:What did you find?Present the MOST important findings and outcomes.•Move 4: Discussion/Conclusion:What does it mean?Point out implications of the findings for future policy or practice.12https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ynp4HY4lz0zp0hc2g-USOFGD4SwxJI69/view?usp=sharing

The move structure of RA abstracts (cont’d)Move structure of RA abstracts (Hyland, 2000) -800 abstracts (8 disciplines)(1) Introduction (55%)Establishes context of the paperand motivates the researchWorld Context; Research Context; Signiﬁcance of Topic (2) Purpose Indicates purpose, outlines the aim behind the paperDescription of Objectives; Research Questions (3) Method Provides information on design, procedures, data analysis, etc.Data Collection; Data Analysis(4) Product States main findings or results, arguments (5) Conclusion (opt. 22%) Points to application, or wider implications & interpretationStudy Contribution; Implications; Research Directions; Limitations 13

An exampleThis experiment teststhe effect ofchoke type and gun selection on target accuracy in order todetermine the bestgun specifications. Three competent shooters of approximately equivalent marksmanship abilities testedthree different choke types (full, modified, and improved) and two different guns (a Remington 11-87 semi-automatic and a Beretta 682 Gold E). With a confidence level of95%, the gun selection ended upto be the only significant factor. The Beretta was foundmore accurate thanthe Remington possibly becausethe Beretta’s weight is centeredin the middle of the gun whilethe Remington isa little barrel-heavy. However, if the confidence level is loweredto 90%, choke type isalso significant, withthe improved choke being more accuratethan the modified or full. Thus, for target shooting, the most accurate combination would bethe Beretta withan improvedchoke.19

Activity: Analysing the linguistic features of an abstract: Summary1.A typical noun phrase to start describing the research objective/aim:the experiment, this study, this paperYou can also use other things such as a pronoun (we) or prepositional phrases (in this paper, …)2.Frequent use of adjectives/modifiers to describe the research accurately:the best, approximately equivalent, most accurate, also significant, etc3.Different verb tenses for different purposes:present tense (the experiment tests):               research objectivepast tense (tested3 different choke types):     methodpresent + past tenses (endedup, wasfound, iscentred, islowered):   results4.Passive + active voices to diversify the language:ended up, was found, is centred, is lowered5.Connectivesto achieve better coherence and cohesion:because, while, however, thus, etc.6.Modal verbs to soften the tone:wouldbe7.Prepositional phrases instead of relative clauses to add more informationwiththe improved choke beingmore accurate, withan improved choke20

We examine whether conservative white males are more likely than are other adults in the U.S. general public to endorse climate change denial. We draw theoretical and analytical guidance from the identity protective cognition thesis explaining the white male effect and from recent political psychology scholarship documenting the heightened system-justification tendencies of political conservatives. We utilize public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from 2001 to 2010, focusing specifically on five indicators of climate change denial. We find that conservative white males are significantly more likely than are other Americans to endorse denialistviews on all five items, and that these differences are even greater for those conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming very well. Furthermore, the results of our multivariate logistic regression models reveal that the conservative white male effect remains significant when controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender as well as the effects of nine control variables. We thus conclude that the unique views of conservative white males contribute significantly to the high level of climate change denial in the United States.22Global EnviromentalChange (2011)

Activity: Analysing the move structure and the linguistic features of an RA abstract in your own field 1)Download one or two RAs that you think are well-written in your own field. You can use RAs from the 10 you submitted.2)Open Weblink4and find your name in the Google Doc.3)Following the steps that you have been through with the Example Abstracts, highlight different parts of the abstract and identify the moves used in each part. If you find any part in your abstract that does not match any of the moves given in the IMRaDor the IPMPrCmodel, write down the function you think this part fulfils.4)Then, identify typical words/phrases and grammatical patterns that are used in the abstract. Pay attention to the moves/steps these words/phrases and grammatical pattern fulfil. 24https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qviqHuMbDwXp8ajcLzbyHIkmL2QGKWFti2HQkbmEwTE/edit?usp=sharing

Activity 2-5 Reflection on language re-useForm a group of 2-3 students and discuss the following questions.1)Before this course, did you notice any of the move-structure or linguistic features of RA abstracts we have discussed?2)Which usages (e.g. phrases, sentence patterns) do you think you will use in your writing?
