  **Task 1**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Watch the following video from 0:00-2:08 to see why they are so
important. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nYpA2UgV0s>

While watching the video, take notes for the following questions:

1.  What is stress? What is intonation?

> **Stress** is the emphasis given to a syllable in a word or words
> within a sentence and usually involves an increase in volume and a
> change in intonation.

**Intonation** is the way the voice goes up or down.

2.  Which words in a sentence are often stressed?

> While speaking stress and intonation are used to make the important
> content of your talk clear. Often there is a rise in intonation on a
> keyword, but sometimes there is a fall especially at the end of
> sentences.

3.  What is the most important thing in achieving good intonation?

> The important thing is that there is a contrast in intonation with the
> words that surround the one you want to stress.

4.  Without proper stress and intonation when you talk, how will your
    listeners feel?

> [Without]{.underline} appropriate stress and intonation, your
> listeners may miss the point you\'re trying to make. What's worse, you
> may end up sounding like a robot.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 2**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Watch the first two minutes of the following presentation video. How do
you think the speaker has used stress and intonation effectively to
convey meaning?

[Hany Farid: How to spot fake AI photos \| TED
Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hany_farid_how_to_spot_fake_ai_photos?subtitle=en)

1.  Identify some examples of stressed words in the talk.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  Why do you think the speaker stresses these words? What
    characteristics do these words share?

Those words carry important meaning, helping listeners grasp the main
ideas.

3.  In what ways do stress and intonation enhance the meaning conveyed
    during the talk?

Clarifying meaning, expressing emotions and attitudes, maintaining
listener interest, signaling confidence and control, organizing
information

**Giving a Three-Minute-Thesis Presentation**

In a Three-Minute Thesis (3MT) presentation, effectively communicating
your research story is essential for engaging your audience and
conveying the significance of your work. This skill involves
**distilling complex ideas into clear, concise narratives that highlight
key findings and their implications.** Postgraduates must learn to
**structure their presentations logically, employing skills such as
creating a strong opening hook to capture attention, using vivid
language and relatable examples to clarify concepts, and incorporating
visual aids to enhance understanding**. Additionally, **mastering body
language and vocal variety** can help maintain audience interest. By
honing these skills, researchers can make their presentations more
compelling and accessible, ultimately inspiring interest and dialogue
around their work.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 3**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Watch a three-minute thesis video from the Graduate School, Stony Brook
University: [**SBU Three Minute Thesis 2019: Olivia Swanson, 1st Place -
YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvLHvOr-CD4)

Use the following questions to help you analyze the video:

1.  How does the speaker **organize** the talk (read the transcript on
    the next page)? What are the key moves?

2.  What strategies does the speaker use to **explain abstract or
    technical concepts**?

3.  What do you notice about the **body language** used by the speaker?

4.  What do you notice about the **style/tone** of a 3MT presentation?

5.  What do you think about the **delivery skills** of the speaker? What
    makes her a successful speaker?

6.  What **transitional/signal phrases** are used to connect ideas? Are
    they natural and economic (time-saving)?

**Brain in Motion**

**[There\'s so many things that we take for granted each
day]{.underline}**. **[Let\'s consider]{.underline}** a simple sip of
that essential morning coffee as your hand reaches for the mug and
brings it to your mouth, **you**\'re not considering all the muscle
contractions that allow **you** to do this, nor do **you** notice that
while you drink your coffee, the rest of your body is remaining still
behind the scenes. **Our** brains are working really hard to make sure
this all goes smoothly. *But what if, day by day, our brains were no
longer able to direct us in our intended movements, and instead started
signaling our bodies to move in all sorts of unintended ways?* This is
the reality for many people with Parkinson\'s disease. 

Parkinson\'s disease causes symptoms like uncontrollable shaking hands,
difficulty walking and speaking and constantly clenched muscles. **[And
what scientists know is that]{.underline}** the cause of Parkinson\'s
Disease is a loss of a brain chemical called dopamine. And while we\'re
pretty sure that dopamine helps brain cells communicate properly with
one another. **[How exactly it does this job across the brain is still
unclear. So that\'s where people like me come in.]{.underline}**

**[I study Parkinson\'s diseas]{.underline}**e in an area of the brain
called the motor cortex. So why is the motor cortex special? Well, for
any given movement like grasping that coffee mug, it requires
coordinated communication across many brain areas, but the motor cortex
is the last of these brain areas to receive the so called Move signal
before it leaves **your** brain and travels to the rest of your body.
**[You can think of]{.underline}** the motor cortex as a metaphorical
funnel in this way. Iit needs to allow just the right balance of move
signals through. **[So my goal is to]{.underline}** understand how
dopamine plays a role in this communication within the motor cortex. 

**[So the way I study this is]{.underline}** in a simulated Parkinson\'s
disease in a mouse, and in this way, **[I\'m able to look
at]{.underline}** the brain at a much higher level of detail than **[I
would be able to]{.underline}** in an actual Parkinson\'s patient. **[My
work involves]{.underline}** listening in on the communications of brain
cells in the motor cortex. I listen to the move signals they receive and
how they respond. 

**[And what my results have shown is that]{.underline}** dopamine acts
as the neck of this metaphorical funnel. It can completely control how a
cell in the motor cortex responds, the magnitude of its response. And
furthermore, when a brain is depleted of dopamine, suddenly the neck
widens and more mood signals are allowed through, and we find that more
signals are leaving the motor cortex, which might be contributing to
those uncontrollable symptoms that I mentioned earlier. 

**[So the next step would be]{.underline}** finding a way to correct for
this improper communication before real problems start to occur. **[So
my hope is that my work]{.underline}** is a piece of the larger puzzle
of this disorder, and with each advancement in knowledge, we\'re able to
better support those with Parkinson\'s disease and work towards a cure.
Thank you.

  **Task 4**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Find a 3MT presentation video in your field of study (e.g., on YouTube
or the University of Queensland\'s 3MT website: [Three Minute Thesis -
University of
Queensland](https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/watch-3mt)). Analyze the
presentation using the guiding questions in Task 3.

Notes to Teachers: You may select a 3MT video relevant to your students'
discipline(s) and analyze it with your students. Alternatively, you may
ask your students to select and analyze a 3MT video which they find
interesting.

You may use the following three videos:

- **Mosquito borne diseases in the US**
  <https://vimeo.com/user20353817/review/370081235/9d7a96cc4a> 

<!-- -->

- **Assessing and managing cable ageing in nuclear power plants**

            
<https://vimeo.com/user20353817/review/370081216/5a3d853e6c>

- **Planting and fertilising different types of peach trees**

             <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EbNTEV2M8A>   

Suggestions to students:

**Organisation of 3MT presentations:**

- Five typical moves: orientation, rationale, purpose, methods and
  results (Jiang & Qiu, 2022)

- Introduces the topic -- grabbing the audience's attention by providing
  surprising data, showing a visual, asking rhetorical questions,
  emphasizing the importance of the topic, etc.

- Explains what is still unknown (the research/knowledge gap)

- Explains the focus/objectives of your research

- Briefly explains the methodology (if possible) and the preliminary
  results (if any)

- Emphasises the potential contribution and the significance of the
  research. 

**Style/Tone of 3MT presentations:**

- A highly frequent use of first and second person pronouns 'I' and
  'you' in 3MT presentations.

- It's appropriate to use rhetorical questions to interact with the
  audience

- It\'s important to use stress and intonation and hand gesture
  effectively to convey messages

- "Hard sciences make more use of stance expressions, especially
  attitude markers which highlight the importance and surprise value of
  research findings, because research subjects in sciences are typically
  abstract beyond a common sense of nature and this heightened
  persuasive interaction oils the wheels of communicating scientific
  knowledge to a wide audience. In contrast, the fluid and disputable
  nature of soft knowledge necessitates dialogic involvement, so
  presenters in the soft disciplines posed more rhetorical questions"
  (Qiu & Jiang, 2021).

- Advice
  on 3MT preparation: <https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/3mt-competitor-guide> 

In Qiu and Jiang's (2021) research, it was found that four stance
resources are used to express "an attitudinal dimension" (how 3MT
presenters project themselves and convey their judgments, opinions and
commitments):

***Hedges*** allow speakers to withhold complete commitment to a
proposition and open a discursive space with listeners' disputation,
such as *might* and *could.*

***Boosters*** help speakers present their work with assurance and shut
down alternative voices, such as *in fact* and *must.*

***Attitude markers*** express speakers' affective attitudes to
propositions, conveying surprise, agreement, appreciation and so on,
such as *good* and *fascinating.*

***Self mention*** marks speakers' overt visibility and ownership to
their contributions, such as *I* and *my.*

In addition, four categories of engagement are examined for the ways
presenters rhetorically focus the listeners' attention and pull them
along with their argument:

***Listener mention*** brings listeners into the on-going speech,
normally through second person pronouns and inclusive first-person
pronouns, such as *you* and *your.*

***Directives*** are instructions to the listeners, mainly expressed
through [imperatives](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/imperatives) and
obligation modals, such as *consider* and *it's important to note.*

***Questions*** invite direct collusion by addressing the listeners as
having an interest in an issue and a willingness to follow the speakers'
argument, such as *And may I ask you a question?*

***Appeals to shared knowledge*** are signals asking listeners to
recognize something as familiar or accepted, such
as *obviously* and *normally.*
