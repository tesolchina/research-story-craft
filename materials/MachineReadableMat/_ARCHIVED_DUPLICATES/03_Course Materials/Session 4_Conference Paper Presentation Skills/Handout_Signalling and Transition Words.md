In an oral presentation, you need to make the topic clear to your audien ce, identify the main sections 
of your talk, and link in your ideas and information so that the presentation flows. This can be done 
with the use of signalling or transition words, which show your audience how the presentation is 
structured and how ideas r elate to each other. This is a form of signposting that creates a path 
through your discussion, to show your audience how everything fits together.
