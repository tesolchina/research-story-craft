**Learning Outcomes:**

By the end of this session, students should be able to:

- structure an academic presentation and use appropriate transitional
  phrases

- apply effective communicative strategies to the delivery of formal
  academic presentations

- explain subject-specific concepts to a non-specialist audience in
  academic presentations using appropriate strategies; and

- explain orally the key concepts and research findings in the
  literature

- handle questions from the audience appropriately in academic
  presentations

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 1**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Academic conferences offer research postgraduates the opportunity to
present ongoing work and discuss their research with peers and scholars
in the field. How much do you know about the academic conferences in
your field? What preparation work do you need to do before presenting
your research at a conference? Discuss the following questions with a
partner:

1.  Conduct an online search for an academic conference that you might
    be interested in attending. What are the types of presentations for
    the conference?

2.  What are the guidelines for preparing an abstract/a full paper as
    stated on the conference website?

3.  What preparation work is needed for a conference presentation?

4.  What do you need to consider when preparing the content of a
    conference presentation?

For more information and tips on presenting at conferences, check out
the e-book *"Presenting your research: conferences, symposiums, poster
presentations and beyond"* by Becker, L. (2014) which is available on
HKBU Library website.

**Analyse Your Audience**

Knowing your audience is critical when preparing for a conference
presentation. Anticipating the interests, needs, background and
knowledge of the audience will help you connect your specific research
to the general interests/concerns in the field. This will make your
presentations more interesting and relevant to the audience.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 2**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some questions you should consider when analyzing your audience
in a conference presentation:

1.  Who are likely to be your audience?

2.  What do you think your audience would like to find out about your
    research?

3.  What are the main aims of the conference? (Review the theme and the
    key words/concepts of the conference)

4.  What are the primary concerns of the field? (How do you bridge the
    gap between your research and your field's broader interest and
    concerns?)

5.  How can you contextualize your research within the
    trends/developments in the field?

Imagine that you are going to give a presentation at the academic
conference you had identified in Task 1 Q1. Analyze your audience using
the questions above. Make notes in the box below and share your views
with a partner.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Basic Structure of a Conference Presentation**

In a conference presentation, you need to choose an aspect of your
research that can be concisely conveyed to an audience within the
timeframe (usually about 20 minutes + 5-10 minutes for Q&A) you are
given. Do not attempt to cover your entire PhD thesis. A useful simple
structure is shown below:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 3**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**General Rules for Giving an Academic Presentation**

As a graduate student, you have many opportunities to give academic
presentations at academic seminars and at academic conferences. Being
able to give an engaging and a well-organized presentation is an
invaluable skill that you should develop during your postgraduate
studies.

Watch a video on "Academic Presentation Skills" prepared by the
University of Melbourne. The video summarizes the general rules for an
academic presentation. Link to the video:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNIO5KkIq7Y>

Watch part 1 of the video (0:00-5:50) about planning and structuring
your presentation. Take notes while watching and use your notes to
answer the following questions:

1.  What are the five things that presenters need to know when preparing
    for a presentation?

<!-- -->

1.  Divide information into sequenced chunks

2.  Be aware of multiple sensory channels -- 2 visuals (you and slides)
    & 1 audio (you)

3.  What you say is only part of the message. Non-verbal behaviour is
    also very important.

4.  "Call to action" -- What do you want them (the audience) to know or
    do?

5.  People imitate your emotions, so be positive

<!-- -->

2.  What is the general structure of an academic presentation?

Introduction -- Tell the audience what you are going to tell them
(Consider using a hook)

Body -- Tell the audience the content (Split into sections with a
logical sequence)

Conclusion -- What you have just told the audience (Recap: take away
message)

3.  The speaker mentioned using a hook at the beginning of the
    presentation to engage the audience. What are some possible ways
    suggested by the speaker?

- Tell a relevant story

- Use a visual

- Tell some interesting facts

- Ask a question

4.  According to the speaker in the video, what are some examples of
    functional language that give signals to the audience about what the
    presenter is saying? Can you think of other signaling and transition
    words for oral presentations?

- Sections -- The first part of the presentation deals with... /The next
  thing I am going to talk about is...

- Transitions -- Let me move on to.../Moving on to the next point...

- To rephrase/clarify -- Let me rephrase/Let me point out that...

- To emphasise -- It is important to note that...

- To summarize -- To sum up...

Now watch part 2 of the video (5:51-9:19) about engaging the audience.
Take notes and use your notes to answer the following questions:

1.  What are the three essential things in a presentation that can
    engage the audience?

<!-- -->

1.  Body language 2. Voice 3. Visuals

<!-- -->

2.  What is body language? Why is body language so important?

Body language includes eye contact, posture, hand gesture, facial
expression, etc.

Effective use of body language can help the speaker to give emphasis,
work off nervousness, and convey messages more effectively.

3.  How can presenters avoid using monotone delivery in presentations?

Memorise key points but not the whole talk. Use your voice as an
emphatic device. Prepare a list of bullet points which are the key
points of the presentation. Highlight the key words and think about how
you might emphasize them.

If you are interested, you can watch the remaining part of the video to
learn about the skills for preparing the visuals.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 4**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Improving Delivery Skills -- Body Language, Rhythm and Sentence
Stress**

**Body Language**

Watch the first two minutes of a TED talk on the topic "A New Class of
Drugs that Could Prevent Depression and PTSD". Observe how the speaker
uses body language (eye contact, hand gestures, body posture) to help
convey messages effectively. (Link to the TED Talk:
<https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_brachman_a_new_class_of_drug_that_could_prevent_depression_and_ptsd#t-118928>)

What body language does the speaker use?

Suggested Answer:

The speaker uses hand movements naturally to communicate messages. She
maintains eye contact with the audience throughout the presentation. She
stands straight and shows confidence when she speaks. Also, she tries to
connect with the audience in different parts of the room by making
slight movements and showing enthusiasm to speak to the audience.

**Rhythm and Sentence Stress**

The appropriate use of sentence stress, intonation, pausing and pace
create a smooth rhythm which makes a speaker sound fluent. There are two
general rules that can be applied to sentence stress.

- **Content words** are those that carry meaning or sense such as verbs,
  nouns and adjectives. These are usually given more stress because they
  carry most of the meaning.

- **Structure words** are small words such as articles, pronouns and
  prepositions that ensure grammatical correctness. These are generally
  unstressed.

The table below illustrates these two general rules.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Content words (more stressed)**  **Structure words (less or
                                     unstressed)**
  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------
  Main verbs                         Pronouns

  Nouns                              Articles

  Adjectives                         Prepositions

  Adverbs                            Conjunctions

  Negatives                          Auxiliaries
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

As well as rules about content and structure words, two other aspects
need to be taken into account when improving the overall rhythm and
fluency of speech.

- **Emphatic / Contrastive stress** can be placed on any kind of word to
  create certain meanings.

- **Sense groups** are clusters of words that form a meaningful unit
  usually indicated by a pause (brief or long, often between breath),
  the use of a "filler" (e.g. "em", "ar", "well", "so" etc.) or the
  lengthening of a final word sound (e.g. "Soooo"). These features are
  normal in everyday spontaneous speech but if there are too many pauses
  and fillers then the smoothness of the rhythm breaks down and it
  places a strain on the listener.

Watch the first minute of the TED talk again and mark the following on
the transcript below:

- Mark words that are stressed by [underlining]{.underline} them.

- Place a red line **\|** where you think there a sense group is or a
  noticeable pause.

Notes to Teachers: This task aims to raise students' awareness about
effective use of sentence stress and pauses when delivering a speech. If
students' independent language learning goals are related to speaking,
especially pronunciation and delivery skills, they can use the suggested
approach to practice. Students can print out the transcripts of TED
talks from the TED website. They can first listen to the speaker and
mark on the transcript. After that, they can audiotape themselves
reading aloud the transcript and then compare their pronunciation with
the speaker of the TED talk.

| So the first antidepressants were made from, of all things, rocket    |
| fuel, left over after World War II. Which is fitting, seeing as       |

| stress disorder or both. But it's not just soldiers that are at high  |

| believed to extend to psychiatric diseases. Until 2014, when my       |
| colleague and I accidentally discovered the first drugs that might    |
| prevent depression and PTSD. We discovered the drugs in mice, and     |
| we're currently studying whether they work in humans. And these       |
| preventative psychopharmaceuticals are not antidepressants. They are  |
| a whole new class of drug. And they work by increasing stress         |

**Handling Questions from the Audience in the Q&A session**

Academic presentations usually end with a Q&A session. How to handle
audience questions effectively is a key part of any presentation. When
the audience ask questions, you know you have engaged them. It is a good
opportunity for you to get feedback on your presentation and your
research. From the audience's questions, you will also find out which
part(s) of your presentation the audience find interesting or which
part(s) of your presentation need(s) clarifications.

In order to prepare yourself for the Q&A session, you should try to
**anticipate the most likely questions** that you will be asked. You may
not predict every question the audience has, but if you are prepared for
some of them and have practiced your responses, you will look more
confident and professional.

Here are some suggested **steps** for handling questions from the
audience:

1.  Welcome questions from the audience.

2.  Listen carefully and actively.

3.  Repeat or paraphrase the question if the room is large, or if the
    questioner has a quiet voice.

4.  Ask for clarification tactfully if the question is unclear.

5.  Keep your answer brief and clear.

6.  Make eye contact with the questioner and the audience when answering
    the question.

7.  Check that the questioner is satisfied with your answer.

8.  Admit it if you do not know the answer. If appropriate, say that you
    will find out and get back to them.

9.  In some circumstances you may open up the question to the whole
    audience.

Some **useful expressions** for the Q&A session:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Welcome questions from the audience:**                              |
|                                                                       |
| - Thank you for listening. If you have any questions, I would be      |
|   pleased to answer them.                                             |
|                                                                       |
| - That brings me to the end of my presentation. Thank you for your    |
|   attention. I'd be glad to answer any questions you might have.      |
|                                                                       |
| **Ask for clarification tactfully:**                                  |
|                                                                       |
| - When you say..., do you mean...?                                    |
|                                                                       |
| - I'm sorry but I'm not sure I understand what you mean by...         |
|                                                                       |
| **Check that the questioner is satisfied with your answer:**          |
|                                                                       |
| - Does this answer your question?                                     |
|                                                                       |
| - I hope this explains the situation for you.                         |
|                                                                       |
| **Admit that you do not know the answer:**                            |
|                                                                       |
| - That's an interesting question. I don't actually know off the top   |
|   of my head, but I'll try to get back to you later with an answer.   |
|                                                                       |
| - I'm afraid I'm unable to answer that at the moment. Perhaps I can   |
|   get back to you later.                                              |

**Practice Your Delivery Skills: Using Your Voice and Body Language
Effectively**

Imagine that you need to explain your research methods to the audience
in an academic conference. Find a partner and practice delivering the
information in two minutes. You may use the guiding questions below to
help you prepare your speech. Feel free to add any information which you
think is relevant to your research design. Pay special attention to the
use of your voice (volume, rhythm, sentence stress and tone) and body
language. Use your phone to video/audio record your speech so that you
can do a self-evaluation later.

1.  What is the overarching research question? Or what is the main
    hypothesis?

2.  What research methods will you use? (e.g. survey? experiments on
    humans or animals?)

3.  What kind of data will you collect?

4.  What materials, if any, do you need to conduct the research?

5.  What is the research procedure?

6.  How will you analyze the data?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 7**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Giving an Academic Presentation to a Non-specialist Audience**

Being able to explain your disciplinary knowledge and concepts to a
non-specialist audience is an important skill that graduate students
need to develop. For example, when presenting at international
conferences, there may be some non-specialist audience. It is also
common for academics to carry out cross-disciplinary research which
requires collaboration between researchers from various disciplines.
Therefore, researchers should be able to explain their disciplinary
knowledge to the experts in other fields. There are a number of skills
that you can use when explaining the technical and disciplinary
concepts/knowledge to the non-specialist audience:

- Avoid unnecessary technical jargon

- Use metaphor

- Use visuals

- Give definitions

- Use examples

- Relate the topic to the audience if possible

Watch a winning example from the 3-minute thesis competition organised
by John Hopkins University. The topic of presentation is "Cancer
Unmasked: How Inhibiting a Small Protein Could Boost Anti-Tumor
Immunity?"

Link to the video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqb6Sq4Ml68&t=58s>

What kinds of skills does the speaker use to explain technical concepts
to the non-specialist audience?

Suggested answers:

- Use diagrams to aid explanations

- Use of Metaphor:

1.  Personification e.g. Tumor cells are **[clever.]{.underline}** Over
    time, they can **[change their appearance]{.underline}**,
    **[adopting disguises]{.underline}** that allow them to evade immune
    control.

2.  Implicit metaphor and simile e.g. Molecules on the T cell surface
    seek out the signs of a healthy cell, and if they find them, **[like
    a light switch]{.underline}**, the T cell is turned off. Tumor cells
    exploit this, **[disguising themselves]{.underline}** as healthy
    cells and **[switching off any T cells]{.underline}** that come
    near. One of these **[switch-like molecules]{.underline}** is called
    LAG-3. As the T cell nears the tumor, something **[flips the LAG-3
    switch]{.underline}**, making this cancer-killing cell inactive. I
    have identified the **[culprit]{.underline}** as a small protein
    called galectin-3.

- Simplify the technical complexity and avoid unnecessary technical
  jargon

<!-- -->

- Connect the topic to the audience e.g. Inside each of us right now,
  cancer-like cells are growing. Most of us have healthy, active immune
  systems.

Note to Teachers: Remind students that they will need to use some of the
skills discussed above in their oral presentation assessments when they
talk about the disciplinary knowledge/concepts.

**Task 5**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 8**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Explaining Technical Disciplinary Concepts**

Work with a partner who is not from your discipline/not familiar with
your research field. Select a key technical concept in your research
field/niche and use the strategies introduced in Task 4 to explain the
concept to your partner. Ask ChatGPT for some suggestions regarding how
to explain the chosen technical concept to a non-specialist.

After you have finished your explanation, check whether your partner
understands the concept and evaluate the clarity of your explanation.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 9**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

In session 5 of the course, you will need to give an 8-minute oral
presentation on a journal article in your field to the non-specialist
audience (your classmates and lecturer) and explain how the article is
relevant to your research. You should [explain the key findings and the
significance of the research, and elucidate how the research reported in
the journal article may impact your own research design.]{.underline}

Now practice giving an oral presentation on a journal article to a
classmate. You do not need to use PowerPoint slides in this practice,
but please prepare slides in your oral presentation assessment in
session 7. Use the following evaluation form to give feedback on your
partner's presentation.

**Sharing Your Independent Language Learning Progress**

In session 1, you were asked to set language learning goals for yourself
and to create a language learning plan. Now share your learning progress
in small groups using the guiding questions below:

1.  What is/are your language learning goals?

2.  What learning materials and methods have you used so far to help you
    improve the identified language area?

3.  Do you think the materials and methods are effective? Why?

4.  What language learning problems have you encountered and how do you
    plan to overcome the problems?

5.  Based on the above, which materials and methods might you use in the
    future?

Notes to Teacher: This task serves as a progress check. You may ask
students to refer to the suggested online resources on Moodle if they
cannot find suitable language learning materials. You may also remind
students that they can discuss their independent language learning plan
and progress with you in the individual consultations.
