+=======================================================================+

**Learning Outcomes:**

By the end of this session, students should be able to:

- write the abstract and acknowledgements sections using appropriate
  organizational structure and linguistic features

- use appropriate rhetorical devices to enhance cohesion and coherence
  in academic writing

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Warm-up Task**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Form a group of 2-3 students and discuss the following questions.

1.  Why is the abstract necessary for academic research articles?

2.  What kind of information do you think should be included in an
    abstract?

3.  Is there a structure for research article abstracts?

4.  When is an abstract usually written? At the beginning of the
    research stage or near the final stage of the paper /after
    completion? Why?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 1**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Read the following example abstracts in the fields of Sociology and
Biology. Analyse the move structure and the linguistic features.

| [Example 1]{.underline}                                               |
|                                                                       |
| Low-income parents have long been demonised in both political         |
| discourses and mainstream media, portrayed as lacking in parenting    |
| skills not just financial resources. Using the Millennium Cohort      |
| Study (MCS) this article examines to what extent there are            |
| differences in the parenting of low-income mothers by examining       |
| parenting behaviours of low-, middle- and high-income mothers. The    |
| findings show that where there are negative differences in the        |
| parenting of low-income mothers these are often part of a broader     |
| income gradient that extends all the way up the distribution, rather  |
| than unique to low-income mothers. Furthermore, there are some        |
| positive differences in parenting among low-income mothers compared   |
| to middle-income mothers. These findings have important implications: |
| low-income parents are not an unusual or deviant group parenting      |
| differently to everyone else. The findings suggest more attention     |
| ought to be given to parenting differences higher up the income       |
| distribution. In focusing on low-income parents only, existing        |
| evidence exaggerates differences and wrongly identifies low-income    |
| parents as problematic.                                               |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| **Background**                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| Patients with pelvic malignancies often receive radiosensitising      |
| chemotherapy with radiotherapy to improve survival; however, this is  |
| at the expense of increased normal tissue toxicity, particularly in   |
| elderly patients. Here, we explore if an alternative, low-cost, and   |
| non-toxic approach can achieve radiosensitisation in mice             |
| transplanted with human bladder cancer cells. Other investigators     |
| have shown slower growth of transplanted tumours in mice fed          |
| high-fibre diets. We hypothesised that mice fed a high-fibre diet     |
| would have improved tumour control following ionising radiation (IR)  |
| and that this would be mediated through the gut microbiota.           |
|                                                                       |
| **Results**                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| We investigated the effects of four different diets (low-fibre,       |
| soluble high-fibre, insoluble high-fibre, and mixed soluble/insoluble |
| high-fibre diets) on tumour growth in immunodeficient mice implanted  |
| with human bladder cancer flank xenografts and treated with ionising  |
| radiation, simultaneously investigating the composition of their gut  |
| microbiomes by 16S rRNA sequencing. A significantly higher relative   |
| abundance of *Bacteroides acidifaciens* was seen in the gut (faecal)  |
| microbiome of the soluble high-fibre group, and the soluble           |
| high-fibre diet resulted in delayed tumour growth after irradiation   |
| compared to the other groups. Within the soluble high-fibre group,    |
| responders to irradiation had significantly higher abundance of *B.   |
| acidifaciens* than non-responders. When all mice fed with different   |
| diets were pooled, an association was found between the survival time |
| of mice and relative abundance of *B. acidifaciens*. The gut          |
| microbiome in responders was predicted to be enriched for             |
| carbohydrate metabolism pathways, and in vitro experiments on the     |
| transplanted human bladder cancer cell line suggested a role for      |
| microbial-generated short-chain fatty acids and/or other metabolites  |
| in the enhanced radiosensitivity of the tumour cells.                 |
|                                                                       |

| Soluble high-fibre diets sensitised tumour xenografts to irradiation, |
| and this phenotype was associated with modification of the microbiome |
| and positively correlated with *B. acidifaciens* abundance. Our       |
| findings might be exploitable for improving radiotherapy response in  |
| human patients.                                                       |

2.  What language features (e.g. tense, voice, cohesive devices, hedging
    devices) are found in the example abstracts?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 2**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Have a look at the following two abstracts. Do you think they are
well-written? Why?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| In this article, research as \"mass media\" is appraised. \"Videocy\" |
| or videoed research results are examined. A form of video research    |
| with its roots in action research, Cabalistic methodology and oral    |
| anthropology is reported on. The counterparts it produces, wherein    |
| disclosure loops are used to produce an effect similar to the         |
| fractalizations of reality, achieves a powerful simulation of         |
| reality. But is it a \"responsible\" form of (research) practice?     |

| This paper presents and assesses a framework for an engineering       |
| capstone design program. We explain how student preparation, project  |
| selection, and instructor mentorship are the three key elements that  |
| must be addressed before the capstone experience is ready for the     |
| students. Next, we describe a way to administer and execute the       |
| capstone design experience including design workshops and lead        |
| engineers. We describe the importance in assessing the capstone       |
| design experience and report recent assessment results of our         |
| framework. We comment specifically on what students thought were the  |
| most important aspects of their experience in engineering capstone    |
| design and provide quantitative insight into what parts of the        |
| framework are most important.                                         |

  **Task 3**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyse the move structure and the linguistic features of an RA abstract
in your own field. Make notes in the table below.

1.  Download one or two research articles that you think are
    well-written in your own field. You can also use the research
    articles that you have collected.

2.  Follow the steps that you have been through with the example
    abstracts above, highlight different parts of the abstract and
    identify the moves in each part.

3.  Identify the typical words/phrases and grammatical patterns that are
    used in the abstract. Pay attention to the moves/steps these
    words/phrases and grammatical pattern fulfil. You may ask ChatGPT to
    help you analyse the moves and language features of the abstracts of
    the journal articles in your discipline.

**Writing the Acknowledgements Section**

Hyland and Tse (2004)[^2] studied thesis and dissertation
Acknowledgements section in detail. Their work has shown not only that
there are typical ways in which these texts are organized but also how
students use these texts to display their disciplinary memberships and
networks at the same time as they thank the people that helped them in
their academic undertaking. Hyland points out that these short and
seemingly simple texts "bridge the personal and the public, the social
and the professional, and the academic and the moral".

Hyland and Tse highlighted 3 stages in the Acknowledgements section:

1.  Reflecting -- some introspective comment is made about the writer's
    research experience.

2.  Thanking -- credit is given to individuals and institutions.

3.  Announcing -- responsibility for any flaws or errors is accepted and
    the thesis is dedicated to specific people.

The moves are illustrated in the table below:

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Move                | *Example*                                      |

  **Task 4**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyse the structure of the following Acknowledgements section and
identify the ways the writer has expressed gratitude.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Life has no rehearsals, only performances. Sometimes the performance  |
| is good and other times an undesirable outcome occurs. No matter how  |
| good or bad it is, each performance is recorded in our unique "life   |
| book". The past four years during which I concentrated on research    |
| towards obtaining a PhD degree has been one of the most important     |
| chapters in my "life book". It is a story full of strength, passion,  |
| courage and will-power, which is definitely a huge treasure for me.   |
| This chapter of my life would not have been possible without support  |
| and help from the following people.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| Foremost, I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Professor Kenneth M. |
| Y. Leung, Swire Institute of Marine Science (SWIMS) and School of     |
| Biological Sciences, University of Hong Kong (HKU) for offering me    |
| this opportunity, for guiding me, for encouraging me and for being my |
| role model in both academic and daily life. It has been my great      |
| honour to be his student. I am also extremely grateful to the SWIMS   |
| postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Priscilla T. Y. Leung for her constructive   |
| advice and critical insights on my PhD study. She taught me all the   |
| essential molecular techniques, trained my ability to work in a       |
| well-organised manner and helped me out during my lowest ebb,         |
| patiently revising my writing over and over again. Without her help,  |
| I could not continue smoothly my study. Dr. C. S. Lui, Department of  |
| Statistics and Actuarial Science, HKU, assisted me greatly in         |
| designing and writing the computer programme for calculating the area |
| of thermal tolerance polygons using a Bayesian approach.              |
|                                                                       |
| I wish to thank Professor Eddy Y. Zeng, Guangzhou Institute of        |
| Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for allowing me to work in |
| his lab and obtain the skills/techniques for the measurement of       |
| dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane in my fish samples. Additionally, I   |
| would like to acknowledge the technical support from Helen Leung      |
| (SBS), Cecily Law (SWIMS), Maria Lo (SBS) and Iris Tse (SBS).         |
|                                                                       |
| Special thanks go to my parents for supporting my education and       |
| understanding my career. I also thank my boyfriend, Junmin Wu, for    |
| his endless care over the past four years. I cannot name everyone who |
| has helped make my time at HKU such a memorable experience, but       |
| collectively so many people have contributed to this wonderful and    |
| colourful PhD period.                                                 |

**Structuring your Thesis: Coherence, Cohesion and Signposting**

The organisation of a thesis can be studied from the perspective of
macrostructure and microstructure. Does the text have a clear
macrostructure that suits the overall communicative intent of the
thesis? Are the ideas properly linked to enable the text to have
internal unity? These are questions you should ask as a writer and your
reader will ask as someone who needs to comprehend your work.

[Coherence]{.underline}

Coherence is concerned with the connection and logical flow of ideas in
a text to create unity.

[Cohesion]{.underline}

Cohesion is concerned with the links between words and sentences.

[Signposting]{.underline}

A thesis should have an informative title, headings, and subheadings. It
should present information in a logical order; include all essential
steps in any argument and make any implications clear; give sufficient
evidence; give examples where appropriate; and explain why any point is
particularly important.

Signposts signal key aspects of the work, such as purpose, structure,
author's stance, main points, direction of the argument, conclusions.

Signposting is a particular kind of meta-narrative which allows the
reader to understand the intentions of the writer, and to understand the
way(s) in which the text will proceed.

The first signpost in a thesis is the title and this needs to be as
informative as possible. Include all necessary key words to correctly
and fully convey the content of the study. Delete all words that are
redundant or do not contribute to the essential meaning. Order the words
to reflect accurately the meaning you intend to convey.

**Creating an Effective Title for a Research Paper/Thesis**

**[Part 1:]{.underline}** Have a look at the titles of a few research
papers that you have been reading. What are some features of a good
title?

1.  Choose a journal article title that you think is effective. Put the
    title in the shared document created by your teacher.

2.  Discuss in pairs. What makes a research paper/thesis title
    effective?

**Read the advice given by a journal publisher Springer: [Title,

**[Coherence]{.underline}**

Techniques for enhancing the **coherence** of writing include:

1.  A **macrostructure** that provides a pattern characteristic and
    appropriate to its communicative purpose (e.g. using a chronological
    approach to tell a story, explaining the problem before suggesting
    the solutions in a problem-solution essay)

2.  An **information structure** that guides the reader in understanding
    how information is organized and how the topic of text is developed
    (e.g. giving old information before new information)

3.  **Connectivity of the underlying content** evidenced by relations
    between propositions (e.g. giving supporting evidence and examples
    to support a proposition)

4.  **Connectivity of the surface text** evidenced by the presence of
    **cohesive devices** (e.g. pronoun references -- he, she, it, this,
    that; conjunctions -- but, also, therefore, however) and content
    lexical ties (e.g. repetition, synonymy/antonymy, and
    superordinates/hyponymy -- animals/cats)

5.  **Appropriate metadiscourse features**: Some examples are logical
    connectives (e.g. therefore, but), sequencers (e.g. firstly,
    secondly, finally), certainty markers (e.g. certainly, no doubt) and
    hedges (e.g. can, may)

  **Task 6**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now, let's focus on how to improve coherence in academic writing!**

**[New]{.mark}**

**Example 1: [The problem]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} [the lecturer's
inability to speak loudly enough]{.mark}.

**[Theme]{.mark}**

**[Theme]{.mark}**

**Example 2: [The problem with holding the lecture in such a large
lecture theatre]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} [the lecturer's inability to speak
loudly enough]{.mark}.

**[New]{.mark}**

The **Theme** of a sentence or clause tells the reader what the sentence
is about.

> • It sets up an expectation that the rest of the information in the
> sentence (the New) will be related to the Theme in some meaningful
> way.

The **New** of a sentence generally introduces new information about the
Theme.

**Effectively developing coherence: strategy 1**

**[Text 1:]{.underline}**

**Rocks** were originally used to carry carved or pained messages
(Benson 1990)... **Scrolled leather, onto which messages were crudely
scratched**, was used in later Neolithic times (Hardy 1984)... **Heavy
hand-copied parchment** took over in the Middle Ages // when monks had
the leisure to embellish them with fine inks and costly gold leafing
(Santos 1996).

The themes in this paragraph focus the reader's attention on: **The
media use for writing**

**[Text 2:]{.underline}**

**The amount of available literature** on the causes of obesity in
children has snowballed in recent years. While **American studies**
(Smith 2002, Benson 2004) have, not surprisingly, focused on the impact
of junk food on children's eating habits, // **European research** has
tended to place more emphasis on the increasingly sedentary lifestyle of
most 2-15 year olds. Although the conclusions differ in respect of the
role of parent modelling, // researchers and nutritionists from both
sides of the Atlantic **are unanimous** in their isolation of television
and computer games as the main culprits in childhood inactivity.

What is the **theme** of this passage?
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Effectively developing coherence: strategy 2**

**[Example 1:]{.underline}**

Poor education is **associated with economic disadvantage**.

**Economic disadvantage** helps to ensure // that the next generation of
children is also deprived **of opportunities to better themselves**.

**Since self-betterment** is a constant expectation of our society,
those who fail to engage in it will always be at a psychological as well
as a financial disadvantage.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Logical flow of ideas:** Economic disadvantage 🡪 economic
  disadvantage 🡪 better themselves 🡪 self-betterment
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 2:**

The issue of educational disadvantage has been widely studied **in the
developing world**.

**Countries such as Bangladesh, Afghanistan and many African nations**
have **extremely poor levels of education compared to the developed
countries**.

**However, the Western world** seems little concerned **with its
responsibility to shoulder the economic and humanitarian consequences of
continued poverty as a result of stagnant educational achievement**.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Logical flow of ideas:** Developing world 🡪 Bangladesh, Afghanistan
  and many African nations 🡪 developed countries 🡪 the Western world.

**Which text is more coherent? Why?**

[Text A]{.underline}

Attracting customers to buy your products and services needs a great
deal of research and planning to ensure the money you invest in gaining
customers pays off.  This is normally achieved through market research
and involves finding more about the people you hope to sell to.  Armed
with this information you can then formulate an effective plan of action
based on your evidence. Once you are aware of the needs of your
potential customers you need to examine your product in detail, fix a
suitable price which will help your product sell, ensure you choose the
correct method of distribution and select an appropriate promotion to
attract your audience. This is known as the marketing mix and can help
your business to spend money wisely with the best results.

[Text B]{.underline}

Attracting customers to buy your products and services needs a great
deal of research and planning to ensure the money you invest in gaining
customers pays off. Firstly, there is market research and involves
finding more about the people you hope to sell to.  Secondly, formulate
an effective plan of action based on your evidence. Furthermore, it is
important to examine your product in detail. Moreover, you should fix a
suitable price which will help your product sell, ensure you choose the
correct method of distribution and select an appropriate promotion to
attract your audience. So this is known as the marketing mix and in
summary it can help your business to spend money wisely with the best
results.

**Note:**

Themes can be repeated in many different ways. For example, they can be:

- Repeated using the same wording

- Repeated using synonyms or near synonyms

- Assumed or understood rather than explicitly repeated

- Repeated using pronouns

**[Cohesion]{.underline}**

All languages provide a certain number of lexico-grammatical elements
which highlight, on the sentence and paragraph level, the sense relation
of one textual unit to those preceding or following it. Such formal or
stylistic devices have a guiding function for the reader. They support
and speed up the cognitive processes by which a reader constructs the
overall meaning of the linearly incoming textual information. This is
why an author must take care that there is a tight fit of meaning and
form. The cohesive elements which languages offer for the structuring
and ease of understanding of texts can best be illustrated by some
examples.

Strategies for making a text more cohesive include the use of:

I.  Transitions or connectives

II. Referencing

III. Lexical chains

IV. Anaphoric nouns

V.  Substitution and ellipsis

**I. Transitions**

- One of the ways of comprehensibly presenting and structuring
  information is the **chronological presentation of facts or events**.
  There are a few options for making clear the order in which 'things'
  happened. A straightforward way of making clear their sequence is the
  use of lexical items like *first ... second ... third ....finally*. In
  certain types of stories or reports a similar effect is achieved by
  the use of lexical items like in the beginning/at the start/to start
  with/after that/and then/in between/before that/following on that/in
  the end ...

- In other texts the sense relations among the individual parts of a
  text may be that they **compare, contrast, or evaluate facts or events
  or ideas** by using words like *similarly/in the same way/in a
  different way/on the one hand ... on the other hand/in
  contrast/though/however/moreover/in addition/on top of .../whereas...*

- When authors **present arguments or cause and effect relations** they
  typically use words and phrases like *because/consequently/ therefore/
  as a result/ ... Conditional truths may be announced by words like
  depending on/ given that/ assuming that...*

Here is a brief list of some common discourse markers:

+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **Types**        | **Examples**                                        |
+==================+=====================================================+
| To add           | also, and, again, and then, equally important,      |
|                  | finally, further, furthermore, too, next, lastly,   |
|                  | what is more, moreover, in addition, first (second) |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| To               | whereas, but, yet, on the other hand, however,      |
| compare/contrast | nevertheless, on the contrary, by comparison,       |
|                  | compared to, although, conversely, meanwhile, in    |
|                  | contrast, notwithstanding, alternatively,           |
|                  | otherwise, instead,                                 |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| To show effect   | because, for, since, that is, due to, thus,         |
|                  | therefore, hence, accordingly                       |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| To sequence      | first(ly), second(ly), finally, previously,         |
|                  | formerly, next, then, later, lastly, and so forth,  |
|                  | following, afterwards, subsequently, concurrently,  |
|                  | simultaneously                                      |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| To repeat        | in other words, in brief, as noted, that is         |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| To emphasize     | definitely, extremely, obviously, indeed,           |
|                  | absolutely, never, emphatically, unquestionably,    |
| (use sparingly)  | without doubt, certainly, undeniably, without       |
|                  | reservation                                         |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| To provide       | for example, for instance, to demonstrate, to       |
| example          | illustrate, as an illustration                      |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| To conclude      | in brief, on the whole, summing up, to conclude, in |
|                  | conclusion, as a result, consequently, all in all   |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

**II. Referencing -- pronouns, demonstratives, or other expressions to
refer back to something previously mentioned or to point forward to
something that will be mentioned later**

1.  **Personal and possesive pronouns**

Be careful when using pronouns (words such as it, they, them, he, him,
she and her). If pronouns are overused, the focus can be hard for the
reader \[What is 'it' or 'they'?\].

**There is often confusion over whether the use of pronouns is singular
or plural.**

![A picture containing knife, bird, table Description automatically
generated](media/image3.png){width="6.007895888013998in"
height="0.9114545056867891in"}

**Another mistake involves using a pronoun which could refer to more
than one subject.**

![](media/image4.png){width="6.5in" height="0.4826388888888889in"}

A pronoun must agree with its antecedent (i.e. the noun to which the
pronoun refers) and the relationship between the two must be clear and
unambiguous. Vague pronoun reference occurs when this relationship is
not clear.

A pronoun can only be used to replace a noun if its reference is
immediately obvious and not confusing. Check that if you are referring
to a person, you use the correct pronoun, i.e. 'he' or 'she', and
generally that your use of pronouns is not misleading.

2.  **Demonstratives of the definite article 'the' + a signaling noun**

e.g. this, that, these, those, such, the + NOUN

- However, the researchers also conducted a subsequent study.
  **[This]{.underline} study** strongly confirmed the results of the
  previous one.

- The qualities of a good critic are clear perception, fine sensibility
  and eloquence. **[These]{.underline}** same qualities are needed by
  lecturers.

- He was faced with a difficult choice. **[The]{.underline} choice** he
  made demonstrated his ability to make sound decisions under extreme
  pressure.

3.  **Comparatives**

e.g. another, other, both, similar, the same, better, earlier, previous,
later, subsequent

- The research has undoubtedly revolutionized thinking in the field.
  **[The same]{.underline}** could be said of Druy's (2003) later
  research.

- ...it has been shown that in the absence of another meal, **[the
  previous one]{.underline}** may be kept in the stomach for more than
  twice as long as usual (Chitty, 1938), presumably with a gradual
  increase in stomach acidity, ...

- The algorithm could in principle reduce crime but aggravate... Yet,
  **[the opposite]{.underline}** appears to be true in our data.

- The more precise terms that he uses are 'isotropic' and 'Quinean'.
  **[The former]{.underline}** means that anything in the domain of
  belief is potentially relevant to what is being considered; **[the
  latter]{.underline}** means that the falsification or verification of
  propositions is done relative to their status in a scientific theory
  (and, by extension, in a belief system).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 7**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  What does 'they' refer to?

Traditional extraction methods have many benefits, including producing
oils with a low moisture content, but mechanical extraction methods
produce higher yields. Chemical and nutritional analysis has shown that
**they** vary widely depending on the variety of nut used.

2.  Look at the pair of sentences below and decide whether the
    italicised pronoun is used correctly or not.

I am particularly interested in examining the reasons why people speak
differently in different social contexts, how the social functions of
language are realised and how language is used to convey meaning.
***These*** will enable me to develop a deeper understanding of the
problems that students face when learning a new language.

**III. Lexical Chain**

1.  **Synonyms or antonyms**

- HIV AIDS is a **disease** which affects the immune system. Until
  recently, this **condition** was little understood.

- **The way in which money is currently allocated for research**
  encourages poor quality research submissions. **This funding
  mechanism** is in urgent need of overhaul.

- The **mental well-being** of these children is equally important.
  **Unhappiness** and **instability** impact significantly on their
  chances of long-term survival.

2.  **Categorisation (part to whole; or whole to part)**

- The majority of **percussion instruments** entered Western
  **orchestras** and the orchestral repertoire in the late 19^th^
  century.

- Although **drums** of various kinds had long been a feature of Western
  orchestral music, **mallet percussion instruments** were only present
  from the mid-1800s onwards.

**IV. Anaphoric Nouns**

Another useful way to show the connection between the ideas in a
paragraph is what Gill Francis calls anaphoric nouns (or summary nouns).
Look at the following text:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Moulds do not usually grow fast, and conditions had to be found in
  which large quantities of Penicillium notatum could be produced as
  quickly as they were wanted. The solution to this problem was helped by
  N. G. Heatley, a young biochemist also from Hopkins\'s laboratory in
  Cambridge, who had been prevented by the outbreak of war from going to
  work in the Carlsberg laboratories in Copenhagen.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The phrase \"**this problem**\" summarises the text in the first
sentence and thus provides the connection between the two sentences.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Reports of original work, headed often by the names of many joint
  authors, became too full of jargon to be understood even by trained
  scientists who were not working in the particular field. This situation
  persists today, though strong movements towards interdisciplinary
  research help to avoid total fragmentation of scientific understanding.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, the phrase \"**This situation**\" summarises the first sentence.

The phrase: This (or These) + noun(s)

- is very useful in showing the connection between sentences and
  therefore in making sure that the paragraph flows.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 8**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now look at the following sentences and fill in each blank with an
appropriate summary noun.

1.  According to a recent survey, 32% of adults in Hong Kong, down from
    39% twenty years ago, now smoke. This
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can be partly
    attributed to the mounting evidence linking smoking with fatal
    diseases such as cancer.

2.  Nowadays, notebook computers are lighter, more powerful and easier
    to use than they were five years ago. These
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ have led to an increase in
    the sales of these machines.

3.  Ozone levels in the world increased 3% from 1990-92, another 4.5%
    from 1992=94, and an additional 6% from 1994-96. Environmental
    protection organisations are concerned that if this
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ continues, serious
    environmental damage may occur.

4.  The local manufacturers have decided they will more strongly support
    the pollution control of the Environmental Protection Department.
    This \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ was a major factor in the
    drafting of new regulations.

5.  Research has revealed that 20 of the 320 known toxic chemicals in
    the air probably cause more than 2000 cases of cancer annually.
    While this \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ may not seem high, it is still
    a cause for concern.

6.  English teachers know that students need to understand the
    differences between formal and informal language. However, this
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cannot usually be acquired
    quickly.

IV. **Substitution and Ellipsis**

Substitution is the replacement of one item by another and ellipsis is
the omission of the item.

Substitution is one of the methods of cohesion examined by M.A.K.
Halliday and Ruqaiya Hasan in their influential text Cohesion in English
(1976).

- Substitution in text can be of a noun/noun phrase or clause. We
  replace countable nouns or noun phrases with the pronouns one/ones
  after adjectives or demonstratives, e.g. The first book was critical,
  the second ***one*** was not.

- Verbs or verb phrases can be substituted by 'do', e.g. The first
  interviewee responded emphatically to the question, the second one
  ***did not***.

- A verb or verb phrase can also be substituted by 'do so/it/that', e.g.
  Many people would like to smoke in public places, but they are banned
  from ***doing so***.

- If clauses can be replaced by 'if so' or 'if not', e.g. This paper
  expects subjects to be more confident in English after an academic
  writing course; ***if not***, suggestions will be given to improve
  individually.

- Ellipsis is the omission of a noun/pronoun, verb, infinitive or wh-
  clause. The noun or pronoun is often left out in the second of two
  coordinate clauses, e.g. I investigated climate change and ***(I)***
  examined the impact on land resources.

- Although not the case for modals and auxiliaries, verbs can be omitted
  to avoid repeating them, e.g. Coffee appeals to some, tea
  ***(appeals)*** to others.
