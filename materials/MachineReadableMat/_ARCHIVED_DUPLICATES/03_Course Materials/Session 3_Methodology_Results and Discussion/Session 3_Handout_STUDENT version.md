  **Warm-up Task**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Find a partner and discuss the following questions:

1.  What are the main components of the 'Methodology' section/chapter of
    a journal article and a thesis?

2.  Do you think the following statements about the 'Methodology'
    section/chapter are true or false?

|                                                    | True   | False  |
+====================================================+:======:+:======:+
| 1.  The aim of the Methodology section/chapter is  |        |        |
|     to document every single step the researchers  |        |        |
|     took in the research.                          |        |        |
+----------------------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| 2.  Based on the steps detailed in the Methodology |        |        |
|     section/chapter, other researchers should be   |        |        |
|     able to replicate the research.                |        |        |
+----------------------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| 3.  Other researchers should be able to evaluate   |        |        |

The diagram below shows how a particular view of the world reflects the
whole research process. By setting out the interrelationship between
what researchers think can be analyzed (ontological position), linking
it to what researchers can actually know about it (epistemological
position) and how to go about acquiring it, it is possible to comprehend
the impact on what or how you decide to study the problem. However, it
is important to note that ultimately you need to identify the research
strategy that best meets your research objectives.

blocks) of Research]{.underline}**

What is out there to know?

What data can we collect?

How can we go about acquiring that knowledge?

What and how can we know about it?

What precise procedures can we use to acquire it?

**[Methodology vs. Methods]{.underline}**

**Methodology** refers to a theory or framework in which the researcher
is taking (e.g. quantitative or qualitative), and the argument that is
given to justify choices made in the theory as well as the specific
method(s) selected. It requires a clear explanation and rationale. Some
parts are quite theoretical or academic (making reference to other
studies or books/articles on research methods), while other parts are
more practical (how to).

**Method(s)** refers to actual research instruments and
participants/materials used (e.g. interviews or discourse analysis, lab
equipment, statistics, etc.). Writers need to justify why each method
was chosen, and not others (justify choices using the literature).

Researchers who examined the moves of the Methods sections in various
disciplines have proposed the **Demonstrating Rigour and Credibility
(DRaC) move/step model to explicate the general roles of the Methods
section**: **Orientation** (referencing previous works, providing
general information), **description** (of setting, subjects, data,
tools, variables); **demonstration** (of experimental procedures and
data analysis); **argumentation** (when rationalizing decisions); and
**persuasion** (when rationalizing data processing/analysis)[^1]. They
argue that, in fact, it is the nature of research, not the rhetorical
conventions, that determines how you should describe and explain your
research methodology.

The following table summarizes the common rhetorical moves in the
Methods section.

In addition, Peacock (2011)[^2] studied the structure of the Methods
section in 288 research articles across eight disciplines. The table
below summarizes his findings:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 1**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now refer to a journal article in your discipline you have recently read
and identify the key components and the moves in the Methods section.
Share your findings with a partner and discuss why there might be some
differences in the components and the order of information in the
Methods section of different research.

The general rules for the Methods section are that:

- the text should be organized in a highly logical manner;

- the information provided should allow researchers to repeat the
  research described;

- an appropriate amount of details should be included; and

- clear justifications for the choices of methods should be provided.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 2**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Read the following example of the Methods section from a journal article
in the *Journal of Neurochemistry.* In groups of 3-4, analyze the
language features (e.g. tenses, active/passive voices, sequencers, and
sentence structure). Based on your group's analysis, summarize the
common language features in the Methods section.

| **[We measured]{.underline}** superoxide generation with Dihydroethidium (HEt; 2 μM, Invitrogen). Culturing media **[was first washed  |
| off]{.underline}** with HBSS and all imaging **[was performed]{.underline}** in HBSS (Gibco). **[To avoid accumulation of oxidized     |
| products, HEt was not preloaded to the cells, but was added to the solutions in the beginning of the experiments in primary            |
| co‐cultures.]{.underline}** Phototoxicity and photobleaching of cells **[were minimized]{.underline}** by limiting the light exposure  |
| to the time of acquisition of the images. Fluorescent images **[were acquired]{.underline}** with a frame interval of 10s. **[After    |
| the above procedure]{.underline}**, data **[were analysed]{.underline}** using software from Andor IQ (Belfast, UK).                   |

| DAF‐FM **[was measured]{.underline}** using excitation 488 nm and emission 510--560 nm. Illumination intensity **[was                  |
| kept]{.underline}** to a minimum (at 0.1--0.2% of laser output) to avoid phototoxicity and the pinhole set to give an optical slice of |
| \~ 2 μm. Addition of a bright field image allowed separation between neurons and glia, that **[are]{.underline}** visibly different    |
| and **[are situated]{.underline}** on different focal planes. Data **[were acquired]{.underline}** and **[analysed]{.underline}**      |

| **2. Methods**                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| *2.1. Design and Procedure*                                           |
|                                                                       |
| We \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (make) an initial panel of 113 items,   |
| based on literature of social work practice with families, including  |
| aspects such as collaborative and narrative models, common factors    |
| that explain changes in psychosocial interventions, and the           |
| interprofessional collaboration with larger systems. A two-step       |
| process revision of the initial panel                                 |
| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (carry out), and eventually, 67  |
| items were chosen. The first stage \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_     |
| (complete) by two social workers with more than 15 years' experience  |
| in community basic social services. The second stage of the revision  |
| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (implement) by four full time      |
| professors at the University of Illes Balears (Spain), all with       |
| previous experience in social work with FED.                          |
|                                                                       |
| *2.2. Instruments*                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| Two instruments were applied: an Inventory of Collaborative Practices |
| in Social Work with FED, and a sociodemographic questionnaire         |
| specifically designed for this study. The 67 intervention criteria of |
| this Inventory \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (refer) to the different    |
| skills, attitudes, and relational stances that the literature conveys |
| as fundamental for carrying out collaborative practices in social     |
| work (basic social services), not only with families in special       |
| distress but also with larger systems involved with them. Thus, among |
| others, there are items related to the construction of a helping      |
| relationship, the importance of a relational stance as an             |
| appreciative ally, reflection with the family about the intervention  |
| of different professionals at the same time, or the co-construction   |
| of objectives and tasks with the clients. Participants                |
| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (ask) to assess the level of         |
| importance of each item and the level of implementation in their      |
| current practice. A five-point frequency scale was used (5 =          |
| extremely important/always, 4 = very important/very often, 3 =        |
| important/often, 2 = not very important/sometimes, and 1 = not        |
| important/hardly ever).                                               |
|                                                                       |
| Participants also \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill out) a           |
| socio-demographic questionnaire, including questions on gender, age,  |
| and issues related to their specific workplace (such as supervision   |
| or spaces for interprofessional coordination). This survey            |
| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (conduct) between June and       |
| October 2018. A list of 146 social workers in public basic social     |
| services in Mallorca (Spain) provided the sampling frame for this     |
| study. The participants worked in different municipalities across     |
| Mallorca. Public basic social services provide a range of services    |
| for individuals, families, and groups. Act 4/2009 (Illes Balears,     |
| Spain) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (establish) the basic social services |
| to be offered by the regional administration. Thus, social workers    |
| attend to different kinds of requests, and they provide information,  |
| counseling, and support, together with resource management guidance.  |
| These professionals attend FED and work with them at different        |
| levels: (a) individual, including with economic difficulties, social  |
| isolation, and professional insertion; (b) family-relational,         |
| including with the management of the household economy, parenting     |
| abilities, the improvement of relationships, relationships with       |
| larger systems involved in their lives, and coordination to ensure an |
| integral intervention; and (c) socio-cultural, including with their   |
| community connections, their values, and culture.                     |
|                                                                       |
| The principal investigator PI of the study (T.C.) personally          |
| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (contact) each manager of the different  |
| services, in order to explain the aim of the present research and to  |
| ask for their collaboration in the recruitment of participants.       |
| Regarding data collection, participants                               |
| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (complete) the self-administered       |
| questionnaire in their workplaces (during working hours) by prior     |
| appointment. The PI was always in the same room, in order to respond  |
| any inquiries and to guarantee that there were no interruptions while |
| the questionnaire was being completed. The Ethics Committee of the    |
| University of Illes Balears approved the study (70-CER-18).           |
|                                                                       |
| *2.3. Sample*                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| The sample \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (make up) of 121 social workers |
| (mean age = 42 years old; SD = 8.30, range = 23--64; 92.6% females),  |
| who carried out their work in public basic social services in         |
| Mallorca (Spain). The sample universe was made up of 146 social       |
| workers; therefore, the sample \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_       |
| (constitute) 82.88% of the total population under study. The sample   |
| was significant, with a 95% confidence level and a 4% margin of       |
| error. The inclusion criteria were: (1) having a degree in Social     |
| Work; (2) developing their work in basic social services in           |
| (location), with at least 2 months in the current service; and (3)    |
| currently conducting practice with families in special distress       |
| (known as "multi-problem" families).                                  |
|                                                                       |

| The Z Kolmogorov--Smirnov normality test                              |
| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (conduct) to decide whether parametric |
| or non-parametric tests should be run. This test was conducted for    |
| each item of the questionnaire (using as variables the result of      |
| subtracting the levels of implementation from the levels of           |
| importance). The scores were 0.000 for all the items. This test was   |
| also conducted regarding the sociodemographic questionnaire, and as   |
| the scores did not exceed 0.05, non-parametric tests were conducted.  |
| Univariate descriptive analysis, frequency tables, and the Wilcoxon   |
| signed-rank test \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (apply) to the answers of |
| participants regarding the Inventory items (both the levels of        |
| importance and implementation). Bivariate analyses (Kruskal--Wallis   |
| and Mann--Whitney U tests) were applied to analyze the relationships  |
| between the questions and answers in the Inventory related to the     |
| workplace organization. Statistical analyses                          |
| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (carry out) using SPSS 20.0.     |
|                                                                       |

**Presenting and Discussing Research Results**

Although the results and discussion sections are sometimes combined into
one single chapter or section, they have distinct characteristics.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 4**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Find a partner and discuss how "presenting" and "discussing" the
    research results are different. You may comment on the content,
    structure and language features in these two sections.

2.  Study the statements below and decide which are from the results (R)
    or discussion (D) part of a medical journal article on skin cancer
    in children.

**Guidelines for Writing the 'Results' Section of a Thesis and a Journal
Article**

Although there is greater variability when presenting the results in
comparison to the Methodology section, the following guidelines may help
secure the communication of sufficient information.

- Create an appropriate section/chapter title e.g. "Empirical
  Researching Findings", "Data Description, Analysis and Synthesis",
  "Experimental Results", if your results are handled in an explicitly
  separate section or chapter. If you use a thematic approach in
  presenting your research results, the "themes" may be used as the
  section/chapter titles. Use headings and subheadings to indicate the
  progression of content within the section/chapter.

- Write a brief introduction to your results/discussion chapter
  including a) the data you set out to collect; b) the framework for
  your data analysis and c) the context of your (empirical) research.

- Present the main findings concisely, objectively and accurately. The
  past tense is likely to dominate.

- Report your results so as to provide as much information as possible
  about the nature of the differences or relationships.

- Conclude with a statement about the implications.

There are three main moves when writing about research results. The
table below shows the typical elements included in the three moves.

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Move**           | **Purpose**                                     |
+====================+:================================================+
| 1.  Presenting     | Presents preparatory information by:            |
|     metatextual    | previewing, linking, providing background       |
|     information    | information, referring back to methodology,     |
|                    | pointing to location of tables, figures and     |
|                    | graphs                                          |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| 2.  Presenting     | Presents results (findings); presents           |
|     results        | procedures; restates hypotheses or research     |
|                    | questions; states what the data are and         |
|                    | highlights data for reader's attention;         |
|                    | provides evidence e.g. statistics, examples,    |
|                    | frequently presents information visually (e.g.  |
|                    | graphs, tables, figures, photographs).          |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| 3.  Commenting on  | Begins to interpret results and make claims;    |
|     results        | looks for meaning and significance; may point   |
|                    | to contribution to field; makes comparison with |
|                    | previous studies (often for justification of    |
|                    | method or procedure); may comment on strength,  |
|                    | limitations or generalizability of results.     |
|                    |                                                 |
|                    | Note: The commentary may be made in a separate  |
|                    | 'Discussion' section.                           |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Task 5**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Read the following extracts of the "Results" section. The first extract
presents **quantitative data** while the second extract presents
**qualitative data**. Discuss with a partner:

1.  How do the two extracts below differ in their approach to presenting
    quantitative and qualitative results?

2.  What language features are used to present quantitative and
    qualitative data in the two extracts?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **[Extract 1]{.underline}**                                           |
|                                                                       |
| The results of the bivariate analysis (see Table 2) **indicated       |
| significant** associations between digital media exposure, parasocial |
| relationships, collectivism, general political trust, and COVID-19    |
| political trust (r ranged from 0.28 to 0.68, p \< .001). To establish |
| the reliability and validity of the study measures, Confirmatory      |
| factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess the measurement model and    |
| factor loadings of the scale items, and the values of the loadings of |
| the measurement items **were greater than** the recommended value of  |
| 0.50 (see Table 3). We correlated error terms of the same latent      |
| variables. The measurement model's fit was good with the model fit    |
| indices locate within an acceptable range:χ2/df = 60.6, p \< .001,    |
| CFI = 0.942, RMSEA = 0.057, SRMR = 0.039, and TLI = 0.920). The       |
| **value of the average variance** extracted (AVE) for the study       |
| constructs (ranging from 0.51 to 0.63) exceeded the threshold value   |
| of 0.50, which **suggested that** the study measures **had sufficient |
| convergent validity** (Ab Hamid, Sami, & Sidek, 2017). The composite  |
| reliability (CR) value of the study constructs (ranging from 0.88 to  |
| 0.92) also **exceeded the recommended value** of 0.70 (Kline, 2016).  |
| Besides, the research constructs possessed **sufficient discriminant  |
| validity** with the Pearson correlation between each pair of          |
| constructs being **smaller than** the square root of the AVE          |
| estimates (see Table 4). Heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) analysis was    |
| also conducted to **assess discriminant validity**. The results in    |
| Table 5 further **confirmed that the discriminant validity** of the   |
| study constructs was good because the HTMT values were below 0.90     |
| (Gold, Malhotra, & Segars, 2001).                                     |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| For the young and single migrant men we interviewed, leaving home and |
| migrating to cities meant much more than merely finding employment.   |
| **They saw** migration as a journey and an opportunity to open the    |
| doors to affluent urban life; and its increasingly Westernised values |
| of love, romance, and sex (Ma and Cheng 2005). **It also meant**      |
| new-found freedom and the opportunity to pursue individual intimate   |
| desires in a manly and appropriate urban manner. **For these migrant  |
| men, migration entailed being away from home and escaping parental    |
| scrutiny, as well as gaining control in their choice of intimate      |
| partners.** The factories in which they worked provided abundant      |
| opportunities for them to meet intimate partners of the same age. The |
| wide range of entertainment and leisure venues in urban areas gave    |
| them space for dating. **However**, dating was a gendered activity to |
| meet the urban normative ideal of manhood, young migrant men were     |
| expected to take an active role and foot the bill in the dating       |
| process. They were forced to compete with rich urban men who often    |
| enjoyed a higher social status and more financial resources. **The    |
| close association between** dating, consumption, and economic power   |
| in urban areas forced young migrant men, who were often economically  |
| insecure, to confront their class disadvantages as compared with      |
| local men. Mak, a 30-year-old migrant security guard, argued that he  |
| 'lost' his girlfriend to a rich urban man **because of** his          |
| disadvantaged socio-economic status:                                  |
|                                                                       |
| > *Girls like you when you have money and they dump you when you      |
| > don't have money \... I used to have a girlfriend who swore that    |
| > she was determined to marry me. She insisted that if we had         |
| > children she would keep it \... but when she got a job selling beer |
| > in a glamorous night club, she met rich men who visited her every   |
| > night and she changed her heart \... she aborted our baby without   |
| > informing me \... I have no job prospect, I have no money. Rich men |
| > like her \... at the end she went with a Hong Kong man.*            |
|                                                                       |
| Young migrant men broke up with their girlfriends when they realised  |
| that they could not afford to entertain and support the consumption   |
| practices of their female partners. Alternatively, their              |
| relationships were terminated **because** their lovers decided that   |
| they lacked the material means to qualify as marriageable men.        |
| **Migration thus exposed** young migrant men such as Mak to the urban |
| normative ideal of manhood through sexual pursuits buttressed by      |
| financial capital **but** **simultaneously precluded these men from   |
| gaining access to the wealth and income that was central to its       |
| realisation** (Choi and Peng 2016).                                   |

1.  What is the function of the "Discussion" section in a research paper
    and a thesis?

2.  What are the common ways to discuss the research results as
    suggested in the video?

**Moderating Claims and Careful Presentation of Claims in the Discussion
Section/Chapter**

In order to make your writing credible and persuasive, you need to be
aware of how a reader will evaluate its realism, reasonableness and
appropriateness. To achieve this, you need to pay attention to
linguistic delicacy (or "fine tuning") of expression. The way in which
you reveal your stance contributes to author positioning. There are
three main types of devices to reveal your stance: Hedges (e.g. it is
likely that), attitude markers (e.g. I think) and boosters (e.g.
Clearly, there is a need to). Among the three devices, hedging is the
most important one.

Moderating claims and careful presentation of claims is a characteristic
of all fields -- even those that are thought to deal with objective
facts according to Hyland's (2004) research[^3]:

**Hedging Devices**

There are a number of hedging techniques. They are the use of verbs,
modal verbs, adverbs, adjectives, nouns and generalization.

1.  Verbs

> The following "hedging" verbs are often used in academic writing:

***suggest, indicate, estimate, assume, point to***

> The verbs ***appear*** and ***seem*** are used when a writer wishes to
> "distance" himself/herself from the findings (and therefore avoid
> making a strong claim).
>
> Note that the writer also "protects" himself/herself by using the
> phrase ***on the evidence of.*** These expressions are used in a
> similar way: ***according to, on the basis of, based on.***

2.  Modal verbs

> Another way of appearing "confidently uncertain" is to use modal verbs
> such as ***may, might, could*** and ***can.***

3.  Adverbs

> The following adverbs are often used when a writer wishes to express
> caution:
>
> ***probably, potentially, possibly, perhaps, maybe, relatively,
> apparently, arguably, seemingly, presumably, conceivably,
> comparatively***

4.  Adjectives

> Another technique is to use an adjective:
>
> ***probable, possible, uncertain, (un)likely, plausible, reasonable***

5.  Nouns

> The following nouns are often used in academic writing:
>
> ***probability, possibility, assumption, evidence, likelihood, claim,
> potential***

6.  Generalization

> There are several ways in which you can qualify a generalization.
>
> (i). You can use the verb ***tend*** or the noun (have/be a)
> ***tendency*** (to).
>
> (ii). You can use an adverb such as: ***generally, largely, primarily,
> for the most part, predominantly, mainly, usually, to a greater
> extent***
