**Individual Consultations on Academic Writing and Independent Language
Learning Plan**

In the MCCP6020 course, you will have an individual consultation with
your lecturer. Your lecturer will tell you about the logistical
arrangements.

To make good use of the time in the consultation, please do some
preparation work before the consultation. You may discuss any of the
following with your lecturer:

- Feedback on your assessments

- Any issues related to academic writing and speaking

- Your independent language learning plan (e.g. goals, learning methods
  and resources, evaluation of progress)

- Your publication plan

- Any other issues related to language learning

Please use the following table to help you prepare for the
consultations:
