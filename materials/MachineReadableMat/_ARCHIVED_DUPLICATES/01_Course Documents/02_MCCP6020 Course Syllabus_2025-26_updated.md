 Offered as a compulsory course to all research postgraduate students at HKBU, 
Advanced English for Academic Purposes aims to socialize the students into the 
research community where knowledge is constructed and contested through conference 
presentations, research article publications and thesis writing for research degrees. 
Through this course, students will develop competence in presenting their research ideas 
effectively in seminar/conference presentations and writing research article/thesis 
manuscripts for disciplinary journals and their research degrees. Students will study the 
language, features and format of the various stages for preparing conference 
presentations, publishing research articles and writing thesis and  develop a scholarly 
voice of appropriate style and tone through critically analyzing and imitating sample 
research  journal articles of their fields.   Strategies for utilizing AI and technology, along 
with data -driven learning techniques, will be taught to enhance accuracy in academic 
writing and to prevent plagiarism.

10. Course Policies  
 
i). Late submissions of assignments  
Students must complete all course assessments, which in total have to reach at least the 
satisfactory level  in order to pass the course. Please refer to the assessment rubrics for 
details of the assessment criteria and assessment standards.  
 
Late submissions of assignments will incur penalties – one percent of the final score for 
that assignment will be deducted for each day past the deadline (weekends and 
statutory holidays included) . Assignments submitted more than 5 days  after the 
deadline will receive a zero mark. If you have a valid reason for late submission, you should 
discuss it with your lecturer prior to  the assignment due date.  
 
ii). Plagiarism policy  
Plagiarism (i.e. copying from other sources without an acknowledgement or copying other 
students’ work) is not tolerated at HKBU. Should a case of plagiarism be established, 
University regulations will be strictly applied, and these potentially include failing a course 
or being expelled from the University . Please read the University’s guidelines for 
students on academic Integrity . 
 
iii). Use of AI tools in assessments  
While the University encourages the ethical use of AI for learning (e.g. for brainstorming 
ideas, exploring information), submitting the output of generative AI tools , including 
translation tools,  as your own work in any assignment is deemed a violation of the 
University’s academic integrity guidelines . Therefore, if AI detection tools indicate that 
your assignment may consist of any AI -generated text, you will be asked to present a 
detailed record of your use of generative AI tools in the respective assessment for further 
investigation. Nonetheless, pre senting a detailed record does not necessarily serve as 
irrefutable evidence that no violation has occurred. The Course Coordinator has the

 right to make the final decision on whether to apply a penalty and the extent of that 
penalty.  
 
Please note that any texts submitted to generative AI platforms may be added to the 
internal databases of such platforms for unknown purposes, potentially infringing on data 
privacy of the authors of the submitted texts.  
 
You may check whether your writing consists of AI -generated text through the following 
websites:  
GPTZero https://gptzero.me/
