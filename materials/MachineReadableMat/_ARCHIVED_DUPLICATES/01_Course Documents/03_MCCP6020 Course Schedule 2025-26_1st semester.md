**Important Notes to Students:**

1.  The above schedule may be subject to change depending on students'
    disciplinary language needs and scheduling considerations.

2.  In many sessions of the course, you will be asked to analyze sample
    theses and journal articles in your field. Therefore, please
    download at least 10 samples which you think can show the common
    features of academic writing in your discipline and bring them to
    class every week.
