 2 1. HOW SHOULD I USE THE INDEPENDENT LANGUAGE LEARNING GUIDE?  
This guide aims to give you some suggestions about  language learning methods and materials for 
Independent Language Learning. The suggestions are not a complete list. You are expected to look 
beyond those suggested.  You can think of this guide as a manual which you can dip into when you 
need to. In addition to using the readily available online language learning materials, we strongly 
recommend that you use the language learning resources and support services offered by the 
Language Centre to improve your language skills. You may visit this website for mor e details: 
https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/sall/english/  
2. WHAT IS INDEPENDENT LANGUAGE LEARNING?  
Independent language learning is a way of learning where you become increasingly more responsible 
for your own learning both inside and outside of the classroom and aims to make learners more 
independent and autonomous. I n other words, it means “learning how to learn” more effectively. The 
skills you develop from independent learning would prepare you to become a lifelong learner. 
Independent language learning requires you to:  
• investigate and decide  what you need to or want to learn (your learning goals plan created 
early in the course);  
• find and select materials and methods  you will use to achieve those learning goals;  
• keep yourself motivated and deal with your emotions;  
• evaluate  the effectiveness and suitability of the materials and methods you have selected in 
achieving your learning goals as well as evaluating your own language ability and effectiveness 
as a learner;  
• manage how best to cooperate, collaborate and draw on the support and guidance of others  
in reaching your goals (e.g. teachers, language advisors, classmates, friends);  
• monitor  your progress toward achieving your learning goals and meeting the aims of your 
plan;  
• reflect  on your learning experiences to guide you towards more effective goals, materials, 
learning methods, means of monitoring, ways of evaluating, as well as further deve loping your 
ability to reflect; and 
• ultimately become more responsible , independent and autonomous  in your learning.  
Independent language learning mainly involves three key skills. The learning process is cyclical:   
 
• Independent Language 
Learning Goals Plan  
• In-class Sharing of 
Independent Language 
Learning Progress  
• Individual Consultations 
with the Lecturers and 
Language Advisors  
• Reflective journal s 
• Self-assessment of 
performance and 
learning progress

 3 3. SETTING SMART LEARNING GOALS  
 
Your learning goals should be S.M.A.R.T.  Read the following explanations below to understand what 
this acronym means and how to apply it to your independent language learning goals.  
S – Specific  
There are a few ways to make your goal(s) specific:  
• Make your goal a sub -skill of one of the general language skills areas (e.g. listening, speaking, 
reading, writing) that relates to some kind of specific written or spoken text. For example, if 
you want to work on your academic writing skills, your goal co uld be: “ increase  the range of 
sentence structures in journal article /thesis writing (specific written text)”.  
• Work on a ‘transferrable’ sub -skill. This is a sub -skill that can be used in various aspects of your 
English. The most common example of a ‘transferrable’ sub -skill is the grammar skills.  
M- Measurable  
To make your goal measurable, you can:  
• Do something you need to improve or you need to do in the future (e.g. abstract writing for 
conference application, writing a manuscript for journal publication)  
• Complete a certain amount of learning (e.g. have learned 40 academic vocabulary items in 
your discipline; have written two sections of a manuscript for journal publication)  
A – Achievable  
Your goal(s) should be realistic. Do not expect after 10 hours of independent learning you will be a 
fluent speaker of English. Discuss your goal(s) with your lecturer in the individual consultations.  
R – Relevant  
Your goal should clearly relate to some kind of purpose (academic, professional, everyday) and / or a 
language needs. Do not waste time on goals that do not help you improve in some way related to your 
learning needs or purposes.  
Your goal should be a real goal and not an activity. For example, your goal should not be “reading a 
journal article every day”. Reading journal articles is an activity that helps you achieve a goal e.g. Be 
able to use  complex sentence structures in academic writing.  
T – Time -bound  
Your learning goal should be achievable within the time frame you have. For this course, you will only 
be working on short -term goals. However, after this course finishes, you may want to continue with 
independent language learning and set yourself mid -term goals (a few months to a couple of years) 
or even long -term goals (several years, e.g. maybe lifelong learning goals that will help you with your 
career).

 4 Here are some examples of SMART goals:  
1. To use pronunciation features (e.g. stress and intonation , speech chunks ) appropriately for 
different purposes in academic presentations.  
2. To use a range of sentence structures  in academic writing.  
3. To improve  cohesion and coherence in academic writing.  
4. To present my ideas in a more organized way when handling questions from the audience in 
academic presentations and when giving spontaneous speeches.  
Now complete your independent language learning goal plan:  
GOAL 1  
General Skills Area:  
Highlight  which general skills area(s) your goal relates to.  
Listening  Speaking   Reading     Writing    Grammar   Vocabulary

Rationale (In terms of one or more of the following: purpose, language needs, learner style, 
motivation):  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Possible materials (i.e. resources) and methods (i.e. activities, strategies, techniques). Refer to 
independent language learning resource list (available on Moodle) for ideas.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anticipated outcome or progress (What do you expect to achieve by the end of the course?)

 5 4. WHAT IS REFLECTION AND WHY IT MATTERS?  
 
According to the educationalist Graham Gibbs (1988)1, reflection involves six distinct stages within a 
cycle. The cycle is designed to create a ‘virtuous circle’ whereby reflection leads to greater 
improvement in the future:  
 
Why is reflection important for you and your learning?  
☺ Reflection helps you make links between what you learn and how it is actually used in the real 
world; it also helps integrate new knowledge with previous knowledge and develop your 
understanding.

better
What you 
will do in

 6 ☺ Reflecting on and learning from your experiences, including your mistakes, can help you avoid 
repeated mistakes and, at the same time, identify successful aspects of an experience and 
principles which might usefully be applied to other situations.  
 
 
☺ Reflection gives you the chance to explore thoughts and feelings, work through difficult or 
painful experiences, develop self -awareness and bring out fresh insights.  
 
☺ Reflection can help you get away from routine, automatic action and make conscious and 
informed decisions after weighing up all aspects of a situation.  
 
☺ Reflection is highly valued in both academia and in most professions.  
 
To help you reflect on your learning, you may use the following template to keep a record of your 
learning:  
Date/time:  
⚫ Put the length of time / duration of the activity  
⚫ Noting the time is useful because you may find you work more effectively at certain times of the day or 
night.   
Learning goal:  
⚫ Put the Specific Learning Goal that you were working toward in this session.  
What materials I used:  
⚫ Note or describe which resource(s) you used. Make sure that there is enough information so that you can 
find or recreate that resource / activity again.  
- For books and/or readings, give the title, year and author  
- For films and other audio -visual materials give the title and year  
- For online materials give the title, the website and note the URL  
What I did with it & why (Description & Rationale):  
⚫ Describe what you did and the method(s) that you applied.  
⚫ Outline the procedure you followed for the activity, pathway, strategy or technique.  
⚫ Give clear reasons for your choice of materials and methods.  
Reflection:  
STAGE 1 (Description – see What I used and What I did with & why above):  
- Did you learn anything? What?  
STAGE 2 (Thoughts and feelings):  
- Did you enjoy it or find it motivating? Why? / Why not? What other feelings or thoughts did you have?

 7 STAGE 3 (Evaluation):  
- Was the material and/or method worth the time you spent? Why? / Why not  
- How does this material and/or method compare with other ones that you have tried for this learning goal?  
- Did it help you toward your learning goal? How effective was it?  
STAGE 4 (Analysis):  
- What do other people who have tried this material / method think? Do you agree with their views? Why? / 
Why not?  
- Did the time and place of your learning affect the way / how much you learned? How do you know?  
STAGE 5 (Improvements):  
- Could you make the experience/learning better? How?  
STAGE 6 (Future Plan):  
- Would you use this material and/or method again? Why / Why not?  
- What materials and/or methods will you use next time?
