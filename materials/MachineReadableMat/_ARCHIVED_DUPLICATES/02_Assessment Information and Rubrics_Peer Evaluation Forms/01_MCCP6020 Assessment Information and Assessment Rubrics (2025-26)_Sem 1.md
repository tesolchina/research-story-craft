INTRODUCTION  
Move 1 - Establishing a Territory  
• Present the general topic area /research problem . 
• Highlight the importance of the research.  
• Synthesise the key prior research  that supports the 
need for the current research.  
 e.g. Research in [Topic] has gained 
significant attention due to [reasons 
for importance].  (Centrality 
statements)  
Move 2 - Identifying a Niche  
• Introduce an opposing viewpoints/perspective to 
the current state of knowledge . 
• Identify gaps in the existing literature  (no need to  
provide a detailed literature review here) . 
• Explain why addressing these gaps is necessary.  
 e.g. Despite extensive studies on 
[related topic], there remains a lack of 
understanding regarding [specific 
gap].  
Move 3 - Occupying the Niche  
• State your research purpose  or question.  
• Outline the objectives of your research and how it 
will fill the gaps.  
 e.g. This study aims to investigate 
[research question], focusing on 
[specific aspects].  
LITERATURE REVIEW  
Move 1 - Thematic Overview  
• Provide context  (e.g. defining key 
terms/concepts/research teams)  for the literature 
review . 
• Explain the purpose and scope of the review.  
 e.g. Several studies have 
demonstrated that [summary of 
findings].  
Move 2 - Critical Analysis  
• Group the literature according to common themes, 
paradigms, theories, methodologies or 
chronological order.  
• Summarize and synthesize the existing literature. 
Show connections , relationships  or contrasts  e.g. While [Author] (Year) provides 
valuable insights, their approach lacks 
[limitations].

among studies  (e.g. methodologies, findings, 
claims/arguments) . 
• Critique methodologies and findings of the previous 
research.  
 
Move 3 - Research Gaps  
• Reiterate the gaps identified in previous studies.  
• Emphasize the need for further investigation.  
 e.g. There is a clear need for research 
that addresses [identified gaps].  
Move 4 - Conclusion of the Literature Review  
• Summarize key insights and their implications.  
• Set the stage for your research contribution.  
Emphasize the significance of the literature in 
relation to your research question.  
 e.g. By addressing these gaps, this 
research will contribute to [expected 
contributions].  
 
 
IMPORTANT NOTE S: 
• Write 1000-1500  words , excluding end-of-text citations  and annotations.  Despite this range of 
word allowance, make sure you provide sufficient elaboration on your content.

• Ensure that each section flows logically and connects to your overall research aim. Tell a 
coherent research story.  
• Use appropriate academic language and adhere to the formatting guidelines provided.  
• Incorporate citations following the referencing style  commonly used in your discipline .
