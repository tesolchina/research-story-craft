| # **How should I use the Independent Language Learning Guide?**       |
+=======================================================================+

This guide aims to give you some suggestions about language learning
methods and materials for Independent Language Learning. The suggestions
are not a complete list. You are expected to look beyond those
suggested. You can think of this guide as a manual which you can dip
into when you need to. In addition to using the readily available online
language learning materials, we strongly recommend that you use the
language learning resources and support services offered by the Language
Centre to improve your language skills. You may visit this website for
more details: <https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/sall/english/>

| # **What is Independent Language Learning?**                          |
+=======================================================================+

Independent language learning is a way of learning where you become
increasingly more responsible for your own learning both inside and
outside of the classroom and aims to make learners more independent and
autonomous. In other words, it means "learning how to learn" more
effectively. The skills you develop from independent learning would
prepare you to become a lifelong learner. Independent language learning
requires you to:

- **investigate and decide** what you need to or want to learn (your
  learning goals plan created early in the course);

- **find and select materials and methods** you will use to achieve
  those learning goals;

- keep yourself **motivated** and deal with your emotions;

- **evaluate** the effectiveness and suitability of the materials and
  methods you have selected in achieving your learning goals as well as
  evaluating your own language ability and effectiveness as a learner;

- manage how best **to cooperate, collaborate and draw on the support
  and guidance of others** in reaching your goals (e.g. teachers,
  language advisors, classmates, friends);

- **monitor** your progress toward achieving your learning goals and
  meeting the aims of your plan;

- **reflect** on your learning experiences to guide you towards more
  effective goals, materials, learning methods, means of monitoring,
  ways of evaluating, as well as further developing your ability to
  reflect; and

- ultimately become more **responsible, independent and autonomous** in
  your learning.

Independent language learning mainly involves three key skills. The
learning process is cyclical:

| # **Setting SMART learning goals**                                    |
+=======================================================================+

Your learning goals should be **S.M.A.R.T.** Read the following
explanations below to understand what this acronym means and how to
apply it to your independent language learning goals.

**S -- Specific**

There are a few ways to make your goal(s) specific:

- Make your goal a sub-skill of one of the general language skills areas
  (e.g. listening, speaking, reading, writing) that relates to some kind
  of specific written or spoken text. For example, if you want to work
  on your academic writing skills, your goal could be: "increase the
  range of sentence structures in journal article/thesis writing
  (specific written text)".

- Work on a 'transferrable' sub-skill. This is a sub-skill that can be
  used in various aspects of your English. The most common example of a
  'transferrable' sub-skill is the grammar skills.

**M- Measurable**

To make your goal measurable, you can:

- Do something you need to improve or you need to do in the future (e.g.
  abstract writing for conference application, writing a manuscript for
  journal publication)

- Complete a certain amount of learning (e.g. have learned 40 academic
  vocabulary items in your discipline; have written two sections of a
  manuscript for journal publication)

**A -- Achievable**

Your goal(s) should be realistic. Do not expect after 10 hours of
independent learning you will be a fluent speaker of English. Discuss
your goal(s) with your lecturer in the individual consultations.

**R -- Relevant**

Your goal should clearly relate to some kind of purpose (academic,
professional, everyday) and / or a language needs. Do not waste time on
goals that do not help you improve in some way related to your learning
needs or purposes.

Your goal should be a real goal and not an activity. For example, your
goal should not be "reading a journal article every day". Reading
journal articles is an activity that helps you achieve a goal e.g. Be
able to use complex sentence structures in academic writing.

**T -- Time-bound**

Your learning goal should be achievable within the time frame you have.
For this course, you will only be working on short-term goals. However,
after this course finishes, you may want to continue with independent
language learning and set yourself mid-term goals (a few months to a
couple of years) or even long-term goals (several years, e.g. maybe
lifelong learning goals that will help you with your career).

Here are some examples of SMART goals:

1.  To use pronunciation features (e.g. stress and intonation, speech
    chunks) appropriately for different purposes in academic
    presentations.

2.  To use a range of sentence structures in academic writing.

3.  To improve cohesion and coherence in academic writing.

4.  To present my ideas in a more organized way when handling questions
    from the audience in academic presentations and when giving
    spontaneous speeches.

Now complete your independent language learning goal plan:

| # **What is reflection and why it matters?**                          |
+=======================================================================+

According to the educationalist Graham Gibbs (1988)[^1], reflection
involves six distinct stages within a cycle. The cycle is designed to
create a 'virtuous circle' whereby reflection leads to greater
improvement in the future:

**Why is reflection important for you and your learning?**

- Reflection helps you make links between what you learn and how it is
  actually used in the real world; it also helps integrate new knowledge
  with previous knowledge and develop your understanding.

- Reflecting on and learning from your experiences, including your
  mistakes, can help you avoid repeated mistakes and, at the same time,
  identify successful aspects of an experience and principles which
  might usefully be applied to other situations.

- Reflection gives you the chance to explore thoughts and feelings, work
  through difficult or painful experiences, develop self-awareness and
  bring out fresh insights.

- Reflection can help you get away from routine, automatic action and
  make conscious and informed decisions after weighing up all aspects of
  a situation.

- Reflection is highly valued in both academia and in most professions.

To help you reflect on your learning, you may use the following template
to keep a record of your learning:

|         | Words that go together in certain patterns. A very common      |
|         | source of error.                                               |

|         | The type of verbs (e.g. infinitive, gerund) following this     |
